What started as the best day[NL]

has slowly turned into the worst.[A][NL]

After my run-in with Ben and Zo,[NL]

we ended up getting caught by[A][NL]

bandits. I feel like an idiot, and[NL]

this slip may end up being what[A][NL]

screws me. The mongrels threw us[NL]

in cells. Ben and I in one, and I'm[A][NL]

not even sure where they put Zo.[A][NL]

There's nothing left to do now but[NL]

think about an escape plan...[A][X]
