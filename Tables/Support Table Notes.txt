Support list at 8AEBC4
Entries are not in character order but are in rough join order (rough bc route split)
Entries are 24 bytes long
0x0-0x6 = Support partner character IDs, 1 byte each
0x7-0x13 = Support Partner initial values, 1 byte each
0x14-0x20 = Support Partner growth amounts; each turn that begins when them adjacent gives them (growth*1) support points, 1 byte each
0x21 = Number of support partners, 1 byte
0x22 = Entry separator, 2 bytes (Always 0x0000)

Empty support partner, growth, and initial value slots are 0x00

CSV will probably be necessary because not in char ID order so no macro list

There are 3 parts to a support; the character you support with, a base support value, and a support growth
At the start of the game the characters will have the base support value.  Each turn that begins with two support partners adjacent to each other will raise their support value by (1*Support Growth).  When it reaches certain benchmarks, they gain access to a support conversation.

Support Benchmarks:

0x00-0x50 (0-80) = Unranked
0x51 (81-176) = C rank
0xB1-0xF0 (177-240) = B rank
0xF1+ (241+) = A rank

If base is 0 and growth is 1 then it will take 240 turns to go from start to A support

Note that with exactly one exception, all vanilla supports have a growth value of at least 2 (Rennac & Tethys have 1 and a base value of 5, so it takes 235 turns to get their A support :yikes:)



Above 0xF1 does nothing, caps at 0xFF


Support Convos themselves are their own table

At 9ED10C
83 entries
16 bytes per entry
0x0-0x1 = Support Partner 1, character ID
0x2-0x3 = Support Partner 2, character ID
0x4-0x5 = C Conversation, text ID
0x6-0x7 = B Conversation, text ID
0x8-0x9 = A Conversation, text ID
0xA-0xB = Unknown (Always 0x0000)
0xC-0xD = Unknown (Always 0x0000)
0xE-0xF = Unknown (Always 0x0000)

This table, unlike the last one, does *not* have duplicates with each partner in each position
