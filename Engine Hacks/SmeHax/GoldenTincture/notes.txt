cant fuckign fidn the proc I'm looking for

usability check would need to 1. check to see if you're at level 20 (actually at level 19 and you can't use it if you don't have a full level to grow just to be safe), in which case you can't use it, and I think that's it?

effect would just be give 100 exp, which means 1. call the proc that gives exp and 2. pass it the value of 100

this seems easy on the surface so let's see how difficult I make it
