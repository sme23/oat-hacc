##Chapter9Opening1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadJunpei][OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne][OpenLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenRight][LoadOstrava]Finally,[....] we're here.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Indeed. The city of Irrithyl awaits us,[NL]
as do its occupiers.[A]
[OpenRight]Still feeling confident, Jeanne?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Us against the entire occupying[NL]
force of the city.[A][OpenEyes][NL]
I dunno how much I like those odds, lass.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I think we can do this.[A][NL]
Roshal, may I ask you to scout[NL]
for us one last time?[A]
[OpenLeft]Erm[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Of course, Princess![A][OpenLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]I'll go along with him. Just in case.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I agree. Keep an eye on him.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][X]

##Chapter9Opening2
[OpenLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]One, two[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Oh gods, there's a lot of them.[NL]
How big is Lord Gotthard's force anyway?![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava]Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] There's a fair bit of[NL]
horsemen in this gang.[A][NL]
That could give us some hassle.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x108]We[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] We should go back. The more[NL]
we look, the less time we have.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright, let's get going.[A][X]

##Chapter9Opening3
[OpenLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal][OpenFarLeft][LoadJunpei]Well?[....] What'd ya see?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Really bad. Not as bad as on the[NL]
bridge, but still really bad.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm.[....][ToggleMouthMove] Well, we managed to break[NL]
through the forces on the bridge.[A][NL]
I believe we can take the city back.[A]
[OpenRight]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] do you have a plan?[A]
[OpenLeft]I do.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadZo]What did you have in mind?[A]
[OpenLeft]We secure the main entrance of the town,[NL]
before pushing onward to Irrithyl Fortress.[A][NL]
There, we engage Gotthard and strongarm[NL]
him into laying down his arms.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen]That plan works, until you consider[NL]
the possibility that we could be flanked[A][NL]
from behind. I propose leaving a small[NL]
portion of our party to stay behind to[A][NL]
stave off any reinforcements.[ToggleSmile] In any[NL]
other situation, I'd volunteer myself[A][NL]
singularly to stay behind,[ToggleSmile] but this is[NL]
an issue that springs far beyond any[A][NL]
superiority I feel I may have.[A]
[OpenFarRight]For once, I can agree with Ben.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Hey![....] What do you mean "for once?"[A]
[OpenRight]If this is going to work, hitting hard[NL]
once might do the trick.[A]
[OpenLeft]I agree.[NL]
We will all need to be quick and efficient.[A][NL]
If all goes well, Gotthard will have surrendered[NL]
by this afternoon.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]I really hope we can do this.[NL]
It's not in our favor.[A]
[OpenLeft]Are we all prepared?[A]
[OpenRight][OpenEyes]I'm ready to move.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Of course. I'm ready to go.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I was born ready.[A][NL]
Let's show that bastard Gotthard that[NL]
Vernet means business![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal][OpenFarLeft][LoadJunpei]Ready as I'll ever be for this.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Um, same here[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I guess.[A]
[OpenLeft]Then we march. Remember, we must[NL]
move quickly.[A][X]

##Chapter9EnterDoc
[OpenMidRight][LoadDoc][CloseEyes]Well now,[....][OpenEyes] that's a pretty big army[NL]
coming for us.[A][NL]
I'm not so dumb as to blindly follow[NL]
whoever's giving me a paycheck.[A][NL]
Hopefully the incoming army is rich[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter9Village1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungMan]Are you here to liberate us?[A][ToggleSmile][NL]
Thank you! It's been horrible, constantly in[NL]
fear of what those damn Norwhickians[A][NL]
might do to us![ToggleSmile] Here, take this.[A][NL]
It's not much, but it'll cure all your wounds[NL]
when you drink it.[A][X]

##Chapter9Village2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadOldMan]Ah, you're here to free us?[NL]
Thank you very much![A][NL]
That nobleman hasn't done anything yet, but[NL]
I know he's just waiting for the right time.[A][NL]
Here, take this to help you. It's a type of[NL]
magic tome. I used to practice in my youth,[A][NL]
but I'm too old to fight anymore.[A][X]

##Chapter9Village3
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadFreckledWoman]Vernish soldiers? Thank the gods! We've[NL]
been so worried about the occupiers.[A][NL]
Here, please take this money. We were[NL]
saving up to maybe get a weapon to[A][NL]
fight back, but you could use it more.[A][X]

##Chapter9Village4
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadOldWoman][CloseEyes][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ah![....] Get away--![OpenEyes] Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Oh, you're not one of those Norwhickian[NL]
dogs! You scared me![A][NL]
I thought they were going to have come[NL]
after us by now. We've been sitting[A][NL]
scared. Are you here to drive them out?[NL]
Here, you could use this.[A][NL]
I used one like this a long time ago,[NL]
but my bones are old and weary now.[A][X]

##Chapter9Village5
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungWoman]Are you the liberators? Are you injured?[NL]
I'm a member of the clergy, you see,[A][NL]
and I can heal wounds. Though,[NL]
perhaps it would be smarter to simply give[A][NL]
you this staff. It can heal people from[NL]
quite far away, you see. Here, take it.[A][NL]
I'm sure you could get quite good use[NL]
of it.[A][X]

##Chapter9Village6
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadOldMan]It breaks my heart to see Norwhickian[NL]
soldiers here again.[A][NL]
I was alive way back when the border[NL]
skirmishes were ongoing, down in the[A][NL]
city of Fronalie. Used to work at the[NL]
magical college there.[A][NL]
There were quite a few close calls[NL]
while I was there. I always hoped[A][NL]
that perhaps nothing like that would[NL]
ever happen again.[A][NL]
I suppose it was naive to think that,[NL]
though.[A][X]

##DocRecruitment
[OpenMidRight][LoadDoc][OpenMidLeft][LoadJeanne]You there! I suppose I would not[NL]
be able to convince you to lay[A][NL]
down your arms, would I?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Convince me?[....] With what?[A][NL]
You're not going to ask me to help[NL]
you out of the goodness of my[A][NL]
heart, are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If simple words will not work, what[NL]
might sway you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, a certain object always catches[NL]
my eye[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]You want gold.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I have a little something I'm looking for.[NL]
Money certainly helps me getting there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, I am a Princess.[A][NL]
I can give you a fairly large sum of gold,[NL]
once the battle is over.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]A Princess?[....] No shit? You probably bathe[NL]
in the stuff. How much are we talking?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We can talk values after the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Eh, alright. Works for me.[A][X]

##Chapter9BossQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadD'Marco]My name is D'Marco,[NL]
proud soldier of Norwhick![A][NL]
As I breathe, you will not[NL]
pass my stalwart watch![A][X]

##Chapter9BossBen
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen]Y'know, you Norwhickian dogs[NL]
have a lot of nerve coming[A][NL]
onto our soil and mucking[NL]
up our cities like a child[A][NL]
throwing a temper tantrum.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadD'Marco]My Lord wills me, and I[NL]
shall do as he commands.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBen]Then allow me to[NL]
introduce you to your new[A][NL]
Lord. I command you to[NL]
get your sorry asses out of[A][NL]
my country![A][X]

##Chapter9BossDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadD'Marco]Gah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][CloseEyes] I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Lord Gotthard[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter9Ending
[OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenRight][LoadBen][OpenFarRight][LoadZo][OpenLeft][LoadOstrava]Everyone okay?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I am well.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Never better,[....] that commander of theirs was[NL]
worth a hearty laugh.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]I'm okay, I suppose. A little[NL]
tired, but I can keep going.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadJunpei][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal][CloseEyes]That was scary[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes][NL]
I can't believe we've made it this far.[A]
[OpenRight]I'm doin' fine.[NL]
What about you, Osty?[A]
[OpenLeft]I'm doing okay, thank you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Then we must keep moving forward.[NL]
Keep this momentum going.[A][X]
