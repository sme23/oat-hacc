##Chapter4Intro1
[OpenLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenRight][LoadRoshal]A-Almost there. I was being held through[NL]
this corridor.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Are you okay, Roshal?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Is the concern really necessary?[A][NL]
Behind that bilious mask lies[NL]
a natural-born fighter![A]
[OpenFarRight]Well, what's wrong with asking anyway?[A]
[OpenLeft]You're positive this is the right place?[A]
[OpenRight]Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Now I am. I remember running[NL]
through here after I got my weapons[....][NL]
back.[A]
[OpenLeft]How much further? I'm really[NL]
starting to hate this place.[A]
[OpenRight]Not far, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I promise.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Though our objective is to[NL]
sneak through these catacombs,[A][NL]
I cannot help but pray that a flock of[NL]
execrable vermin impedes our progress.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Ben, must you only think about cutting[NL]
down the first person you see?[A][NL]
I know they're lowlife bandits, but[NL]
you're not gaining the glory you want[A][NL]
by charging in after them screaming.[A]
[OpenLeft]I don't see why you're so eager to[NL]
fight, anyway. No one's here to see us win[A][NL]
against some brigands.[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]That's what I said[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarLeft]Oh, I am well aware. I do it not for glory,[NL]
but to see the world rid of scum[A][NL]
such as them.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadGlazette]I certainly hope there's minimal fighting[NL]
I would rather not anyone come to harm.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]If only it was that simple.[....][OpenEyes][NL]
Anyway, we should almost be there.[A][X]

##Chapter4Intro2
[OpenMidRight][LoadThatch]Oi![....] You![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThief]Yea, boss?[A]
[OpenMidRight]These damn brats are gettin' to be a pain.[A][NL]
I'm thinkin' it's about time we kill this[NL]
royal pain of hours for good. Execute[A][NL]
the girl, and be quick about it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Aye, sir.[A][X]

##Chapter4Intro3
[LoadOstrava]That sounds bad, guys. We need[NL]
to beat feet. We gotta find her.[A][X]

##Chapter4BossBattleQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThatch]So yeh got past me men?[NL]
Ha![....] No matter. I'll get the[A][NL]
pleasure in killin' ya lot.[A][X]

##Chapter4BossDeathQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadThatch]Agh! N[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] No[ToggleMouthMove]...[....]![A][X]

##Chapter4Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZorua]She should be nearby[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter4Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoshal]This is it.[....] This is her cell. Is she[NL]
who you were looking for?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen]It appears the fair maiden, whom we[NL]
abandoned our freedoms to dashingly[A][NL]
rescue, is right before our eyes at long[NL]
last![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hey there, miss.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenRight][LoadJeanne][OpenRight][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]Who goes there?[A][NL]
If you have come to kill me, you best[NL]
do it in a single stroke. Otherwise,[A][NL]
I will not go down so easily.[A]
[OpenLeft]I'm Ostrava. You must be the merchant's[NL]
girl, right?[A]
[OpenRight]The[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] merchant's girl?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft](Wait, merchant's girl?! Does he not[NL]
know who the devil she is?!)[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadZorua]Your--[CloseEyes][....][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][OpenEyes] Ah, I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Are you okay?[NL]
Ben and I were hired to come find you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]The lass is correct![A][NL]
The Bringer of Chaos and his charming[NL]
sidekick The Truth Bringer were hand-picked[A][NL]
by a one Godefrey to sneak into this[NL]
despicable highywayman's hideout. [ToggleSmile][A][NL]
[CloseEyes]Granted, we were kidnapped on the way, [OpenEyes]BUT![....][NL]
It was all according to my meticulously[A][NL]
crafted plan, thought up aft--[A]
[OpenRight]Ah, I understand. I am fine, outside of the[NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] lack of food and water, I suppose.[A]
[OpenLeft]Let's get you out of there, miss[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][A]
[OpenRight]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]My name is Jeanne. Princess of Vernet.[NL]
And I thank you for coming to my aid.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]What?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]What?![....] Y-You're the princess?![A]
[OpenFarLeft]"WHO?!"[....] HOW DIMWITTED CAN YOU TWO BE?[NL]
YOU DON'T KNOW OF OUR PRINCESS?![A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadZorua]Ben, calm down! You're not making a good[NL]
first impression in front of Her Majesty![A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Ah![....][OpenEyes] Please forgive my carelessness,[NL]
You Majesty.[A]
[OpenLeft]We have a princess? Since when?[A]
[OpenRight]Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Ostrava, was it?[A]
[OpenLeft]Yes, I'm Ostrava.[A]
[OpenRight]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Ostrava, and you two are[ToggleMouthMove]...[....]?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]I thought you'd never ask![A][OpenEyes][NL]
The handsome, cunning warrior you see[NL]
before you is none other than the almighty[A][NL]
Ben Von--[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]I'm sorry he's like this, Your Highness,[NL]
[....][OpenEyes]but that's Ben and I'm Zo.[A][NL]
As Ben has said before, one of your[NL]
father's guards hired us to save you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes](I'll never get to say it, will I?)[A]
[OpenRight]Ah, I see. Well, thank you for coming to[NL]
my aid. It would probably be best if we did[A][NL]
not dawdle any longer. I find it unlikely that[NL]
there are no more brigands left in this fort.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Where would we even go?[NL]
Reunere is halfway across the country.[A]
[OpenLeft]I know where. It's a village near here[NL]
called Trisdam.[A]
[OpenRight]A village[ToggleMouthMove]...[....]?[ToggleMouthMove] Yes, that would work well.[NL]
Admittedly, I am quite hungry and thirsty.[A][NL]
A village would be a nice place to stop[NL]
and think of what to do next.[A]
[OpenLeft]There's free room and board, and it's pretty[NL]
secluded. Should be safe enough, yeah?[A]
[OpenRight]Indeed. I take it you know the way?[A]
[OpenLeft]I do. It's a bit of a hike, if you[NL]
don't mind that.[A]
[OpenRight]I can handle a hike. What about the rest[NL]
of you?[A]
[OpenFarRight]I'm fine with that.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]I would run laps around the world, if Her[NL]
Majesty requested. The very gods above[A][NL]
have blessed me with the endurance to[NL]
rival even your finest steed.[A]
[OpenRight]Very good. And what about you there,[NL]
archer? I didn't catch your name before.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Ah![....] Who, me? I-I'm Roshal,[NL]
and yes, I can handle a hike.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Well then, it seems we have a destination.[NL]
Lead the way, Sir Ostrava.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Y-Yeah, sure.[....] Whenever you're all ready[NL]
to go.[A][X]

##Chapter4Ending3
[OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadZorua][OpenRight]Oh for the love of the gods, an exit.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Hopefully we won't have to see this[NL]
place again.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoshal]We didn't run into anyone during our[NL]
escape[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Do you think they all left after[A][NL]
their leader died?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne]Well, I would be lying if I said[NL]
I would miss that damned prison.[A][NL]
It is nice to have some fresh air, finally.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yes![....] Freedom![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadBen][OpenLeft]Harken! Comrades, thanks only to our wits[NL]
and sheer strength have we made it out[A][NL]
of that hell hole alive. I feel, horrible as[NL]
it was, we are all stronger people[A][NL]
because of what happened down[NL]
there. The memories made here are[A][NL]
sure to be not ones forgotton.[A][NL]
Now, onwards![....] Trisdam awaits.[A][X]
