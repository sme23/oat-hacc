It's been a few weeks since I[NL]
skiddled from home, and every[A][NL]
day I regret leaving more and more.[NL]
Living in a dusty old tavern in[A][NL]
Trisdam was a hell of a lot better[NL]
than this. Anything is better than[A][NL]
this. Well...[....] there's no point[NL]
crying about it. If I keep looking,[A][NL]
something will come up.[A][X]
