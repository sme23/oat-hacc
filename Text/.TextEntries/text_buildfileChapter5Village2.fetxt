[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidRight][LoadOldMan]A raid?![....] Oh Merroi almighty, thank you for[NL]
warning us! My sword arm isn't as good[A][NL]
as it used to be, so I wouldn't be able to[NL]
protect my family if anyone came looking[A][NL]
for trouble. Oh, I know![....] You can have this![NL]
It's my old sword. Used it back in the day[A][NL]
to kill dragons, or those dirty manaketes.[NL]
You could probably make better use[A][NL]
of it than I.[A][X]
