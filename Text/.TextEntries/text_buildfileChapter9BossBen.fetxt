[OpenMidRight][LoadBen]Y'know, you Norwhickian dogs[NL]

have a lot of nerve coming[A][NL]

onto our soil and mucking[NL]

up our cities like a child[A][NL]

throwing a temper tantrum.[A]

[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadD'Marco]My Lord wills me, and I[NL]

shall do as he commands.[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBen]Then allow me to[NL]

introduce you to your new[A][NL]

Lord. I command you to[NL]

get your sorry asses out of[A][NL]

my country![A][X]
