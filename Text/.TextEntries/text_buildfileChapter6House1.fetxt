[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadRedHead]This forest doesn't have any official name,[NL]
but we locals call it the Tiny Rouge Woods.[A][NL]
We call it that 'cause in the autumn, some of[NL]
the smaller trees' leaves turn a deep red[A][NL]
color. It's real pretty, 'specially at sunset.[NL]
Mighty dangerous, though. More[A][NL]
superstitious people like to think that the[NL]
leaves are stained red with the blood of[A][NL]
those who've passed.[A][X]
