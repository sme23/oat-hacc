[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman]We've been trying to petition the government[NL]
to make a safe route through the forest[A][NL]

and both soldiers and bandits are coming[NL]
down on you. Maybe you'll think twice[A][NL]
about denying us common folk in the[NL]
future, hmm?[A][X]
