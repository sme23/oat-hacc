##Chapter8Intro1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadBen][OpenRight][LoadZo]How long does it take to scout ahead?[NL]
Will Roshal be back soon?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Let's be patient. He's going on his leggies,[NL]
after all.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]Yeah, I know.[NL]
I hope he's okay[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarRight]Knowing the lad, I'm sure he's fending[NL]
for himself valiantly; that is if he's been[A][NL]
caught, period. His presence is quite[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
minimal, to say the least.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Still, slip ups happen.[NL]
Maybe they caught him.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]I highly doubt that our dear Roshal[NL]
has been. He knows what he's doing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadJunpei][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Ya got that right, boy.[NL]
He's just come in with his report.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal]E-Everyone,[....] there's an entire army at[NL]
the bridge! I think Lord Gotthard set up[A][NL]
most of his troops there.[A][X]

##Chapter8Intro2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]That is[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][CloseEyes] Damn. An entire army[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarLeft]We can't go around, it'd take too long.[NL]
Maybe we should just push through.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei]Any of ya got any bright ideas?[A]
[OpenRight][LoadZo]I think we should stick together, and deal[NL]
with them as a group.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal]But we can't stay for too long.[A][NL]
I overheard one of them say they're[NL]
thinking of calling for reinforcements.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]M-More of them?![A]
[OpenFarLeft]We'll need to be quick, then.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadBen][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Those Norwhick dogs![NL]
Who the hell do they think they are?[A][NL]
Waltzing onto OUR soil, seizing OUR[NL]
fortresses, and terrorizing OUR people,[A][NL]
it's inexcusable! I half a mind to take them[NL]
all on myself.[A]
[OpenRight]Ben, it wouldn't help anyone if you ran in[NL]
severely outnumbered on your own.[A][NL]
You've done enough of that at that[NL]
damnable bandit hideout.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]Ugh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] the bandit hideout[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes][NL]
Thankfully I don't have to do anything of[NL]
the sort.[ToggleSmile] Isn't that right, Ostrava?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Compared to this, that was just a[NL]
speck in a cloud[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei]Y'all keep going on about those bandits.[NL]
When are ya gonna tell me what[A][NL]
happened there?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Now isn't a good time.[NL]
We need to prepare for battle.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]Agreed.[....] Let's get ready.[A][X]

##Chapter8House1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadOldWoman][CloseEyes]By the gods[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes] I never could've[NL]
imagined any fighting happening all[A][NL]
the way up here. They say Irrithyl is[NL]
a bastion of culture.[A][NL]
I hope everyone there is okay. There[NL]
are a hell of a lot of soldiers guarding[A][NL]
this river.[CloseEyes] I suppose the best I can do[NL]
is pray for the city's safety.[A][X]

##Chapter8House2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungWoman]My father is a fisherman, fishing[NL]
out of the river.[A][NL]
Officially it's called the Spirale River, but we[NL]
like to call it the Raging River.[A][NL]
The waters here run fast and dangerous.[NL]
Not often you see people try to swim in it.[A][X]

##Chapter8Village
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadYoungMan]Oh, thank Merroi![A][NL]
We were worried that our occupiers might[NL]
try something. But if you're here, we[A][NL]
don't have to worry. Here, take this.[NL]
It'll make you a bit faster.[A][NL]
Useful for getting an extra hit, or[NL]
avoiding enemy attacks.[A][X]

##Chapter8BossQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSulhban]You must be the whelps who[NL]
Gotthard mentioned might try[A][NL]
and cross the river.[A][NL]
Hate to break it to you, but[NL]
you're not getting past me.[A][X]

##Chapter8BossDeathQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSulhban][CloseEyes]Gah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Nice one[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter8Ending1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenFarRight][LoadBen][OpenRight][LoadZo][CloseEyes]Gods, I can't believe we made it[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Was it really surprising?[A][NL]
We are a force to be reckoned with,[NL]
and all those with malicious intent shall[A][NL]
cower before us![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Roshal,[A][NL]
you said that you believed Gotthard had[NL]
stationed most of his army here, correct?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, I think so. His personal[NL]
guard can't be that much bigger[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
r-right?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight]I wouldn't think so.[NL]
Though, we should still play it cautious.[A]
[OpenLeft]Indeed. Now all that remains is whoever[NL]
is protecting him in Irrithyl itself.[A][NL]
Hopefully there is not too much[NL]
damage to the city.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadJunpei]Hopefully they're a hardy bunch.[NL]
Occupation ain't exactly easy living.[A]
[OpenLeft]Our people are strong. I believe[NL]
that they can make it the next[A][NL]
few days until we arrive.[A]
[OpenRight]How far is Irrithyl from here,[NL]
Your Highness?[A]
[OpenLeft]Not far. We should arrive within[NL]
two days time.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]March your frocks then.[A][NL]
Once you're all tuckered out,[NL]
we'll call it for the evening.[A][X]

##Chapter8Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]Jeanne?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, Ostrava?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why're you still up? It's pretty[NL]
late already.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have been working. Studying maps of[NL]
Irrithyl, attempting to formulate a plan[A][NL]
of action when we arrive.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]You don't seriously believe that we[NL]
can do this, do you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Whether or not I believe something is[NL]
irrelevant.[A][NL]
I must protect my people and my nation,[NL]
no matter what else happens.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]I get that, I really do.[OpenEyes][NL]
But this is a little absurd.[A][NL]
Breaking out of some backwards prison[NL]
is one thing, but this?[A][NL]
This doesn't seem like something we[NL]
can do.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Even so, we have a responsibility to do it.[A][NL]
I will not stand by while there are invaders[NL]
in my land.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What about us? I'm all for fighting[NL]
the good fight, but this is punching[A][NL]
above our weight.[NL]
Do you seriously think we can win here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]No.[NL]
But I do not know what else we can do.[A][NL]
If we do not march on the city, things will[NL]
only get worse for the people there.[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]Assuming it isn't damaged beyond repair[NL]
by the occupiers.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And then what?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Once the Norwhickian force has been[NL]
extradited, we shall re-establish order[A][NL]
in the city, and then finally return to the[NL]
capital.[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]What is it?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]Do you believe in us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I believe in how far we have already come.[A][NL]
And if Roshal is to be believed, then[NL]
the worst may yet be behind us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You're ignoring my question,[NL]
I didn't ask that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do believe in us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And we're gonna do this, this honestly[NL]
idiotic plan of yours. We're gunna win, ya?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]We are going to win.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]I hate how confident you are in us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have to be. I have to believe in my[NL]
people.[A][NL]
What is more disheartening than a Princess[NL]
who does not believe her that people[A][NL]
can succeed?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]I suppose you have a point there.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You should sleep. I will finish[NL]
my plans, and then I will sleep, too.[A]
[OpenMidRight]If you say so.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Good night, Princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good night, Ostrava.[A][X]
