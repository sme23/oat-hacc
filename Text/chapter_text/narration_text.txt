##OpeningCutscene1
The continent of Dunham.[A][NL]
Created 1200 years ago by the divine being[NL]
Theoxia, who created the world from the[A][NL]
formless void that existed before.[A][NL]
With the aid of their two children, the[NL]
goddess Merroi, and the god Werecyn,[A][NL]
the land bore life, and two nations[NL]
were created in celebration of this.[A][X]

##OpeningCutscene2
In honor of the Mother of Kings Merroi,[NL]
the Kingdom of Vernet was created,[A][NL]
with its mountains and colder climate.[A][NL]
The people are a wealthy and haughty[NL]
folk, but also value peace greatly.[A][X]

##OpeningCutscene3
In honor of the Father of Kings Werecyn,[NL]
the Empire of Norwhick was created,[A][NL]
with its deserts, jungles, and warmer[NL]
climate.[A][NL]
The people are accepting and open, but[NL]
its history is steeped in war.[A][X]

##OpeningCutscene4
With their task completed, the divine[NL]
Theoxia left the realm forever,[A][NL]
and where they left, a single thing[NL]
remained--[....] a Mask--[A][NL]
The Mask of Dunham, also known as the[NL]
Fire Emblem, charged with divine energy,[A][NL]
and the only thing remained of the creator.[A][NL]
To populate these nations, the twin gods[NL]
created twin races, both equal, but opposite.[A][NL]
Humans and manaketes, living together under[NL]
the promise of harmony.[A][NL]
But as with all histories, this wasn't meant[NL]
to be.[A][X]

##OpeningCutscene5
A divide quickly emerged between the two[NL]
races. Each race laid claim to the divine[A][NL]
Mask of Dunham. And with this divide came[NL]
war. They fought for ages, with the conflict[A][NL]
claiming the lives of thousands. In the end,[NL]
neither side could harness the Mask's full[A][NL]
power, and it was split into three.[A][X]

##OpeningCutscene6
One piece laid with Vernet, a heaven for[NL]
humans and humans alone.[A][NL]
A second was left with Norwhick, where[NL]
both humans and manaketes lived as equals.[A][NL]
The final piece was lost to time, though[NL]
legends say it was claimed by a tribe[A][NL]
of manaketes who rejected humanity, and[NL]
lived somewhere in the mountains between[A][NL]
the two nations.[A][NL]
And so, a peace, however unstable it may be,[NL]
enveloped the land. Tensions between the[A][NL]
elitist but peace-loving Vernet and the open[NL]
but conquest-desiring Norwhich have been[A][NL]
hight for centuries.[A][X]

##OpeningCutscene7
The border, split down near the middle of the[NL]
continent, is a place of great freedom,[A][NL]
but also great danger, as skirmishes are[NL]
frequent and bandits roam free.[A][NL]
Great institutions of battle and magic are[NL]
situated here, such as the Vernish College[A][NL]
of Fronalie where even manaketes are[NL]
accepted, but tensions between humans and[A][NL]
manaketes are at their highest near the[NL]
border, where the two ideals of the[A][NL]
opposing nations collide, and the[NL]
racism and violence comes to a head.[A][NL]
It is here where many adventures begin, and[NL]
it is here where we find our hero, on the[A][NL]
precipice of a great change...[A][X]

##NarrationPrologue
It's been a few weeks since I[NL]
skiddled from home, and every[A][NL]
day I regret leaving more and more.[NL]
Living in a dusty old tavern in[A][NL]
Trisdam was a hell of a lot better[NL]
than this. Anything is better than[A][NL]
this. Well...[....] there's no point[NL]
crying about it. If I keep looking,[A][NL]
something will come up.[A][X]

##NarrationChapter1
What started as the best day[NL]
has slowly turned into the worst.[A][NL]
After my run-in with Ben and Zo,[NL]
we ended up getting caught by[A][NL]
bandits. I feel like an idiot, and[NL]
this slip may end up being what[A][NL]
screws me. The mongrels threw us[NL]
in cells. Ben and I in one, and I'm[A][NL]
not even sure where they put Zo.[A][NL]
There's nothing left to do now but[NL]
think about an escape plan...[A][X]

##NarrationChapter2
Thanks to our new horse-bound[NL]
friends, we're finally free.[A][NL]
Thankfully, it seems that our unfortunate[NL]
imprisonment happened to be run of[A][NL]
good luck. This seems to be the place[NL]
they took the merchant girl.[A][NL]
We plan to push forward, hopefully[NL]
to victory.[A][X]

##NarrationChapter3
Progress through the fort has been[NL]
steady, though rather confusing.[A][NL]
With the aid of Roshal, we have an[NL]
idea of where we're going, but I[A][NL]
doubt it'll make things easier.[A][X]

##NarrationChapter4
I hate this stupid building.[A][NL]
Whoever designed this accursed[NL]
place can burn in proverbial hell.[A][NL]
I feel like we've been walking for[NL]
days, and it's been maybe two hours.[A][NL]
The second we find whoever it is, I'm[NL]
jumping out the godsdamn window.[A][NL]
Roshal said we're almost to where he[NL]
saw her, so the suffering will end soon.[A][X]
