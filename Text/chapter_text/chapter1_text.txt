[OpenMidLeft][LoadZo][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][....] What's going to happen?[NL]
What can I do?[A][NL]
I'm without a weapon and no way out.[NL]
Ostrava and Ben aren't here.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]And[ToggleMouthMove]...[....] *sniff*[ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJuli][OpenMidLeft]Hey, calm down.[NL]
We're gonna find a way out.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]Muh?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZo][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sorry.[....] Who're you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Juliana. I'm a mercenary[NL]
alongside my partner.[A][NL]
He's on his way to save us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Does he know you're here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, he knows. The brigands were holding[NL]
him back when they captured me.[A][NL]
Biggest mistake of their lives. He gets into[NL]
a beserked state when I come to harm.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, really?[....] Thank the gods[NL]
someone's coming[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I'm Zo, by the way[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Thank you[NL]
for keeping me company.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]No problem Zo,[....] but I promise you, we're[NL]
going to get out safe and sound very soon.[A][X]

##Ch1Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadYanik]Juliana, where are you?![A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Damn you, brigands! I'm going to make[NL]
you scream in agony if you dare touch her![A][X]

##YanikGuardInteraction
[OpenMidRight][LoadBandit][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Oi![....] How da hell did ya get in here?![A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadYanik][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]You can ask your friends[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
in Hell![A][OpenFarLeft][MoveRight][X]

##Ch1Opening3
[OpenMidRight][LoadJuli][OpenMidLeft][LoadYanik]Ah,[....] there you are, Juliana![NL]
Tell me, have they hurt you?[A][NL]
I'll paint the walls with thei--[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's alright, Yanik. Took you long enough.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Hey, do you realize how hard it is to[NL]
bust into a bandit's hideout with a lance?[A][NL]
Also, before I forget, I brought you a[NL]
new bow to so you can defend yourself.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Thank you, Yanik. Be safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]You too. Don't worry, I'll watch[NL]
your back.[A][X]

##Ch1LiteralAssPull
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][OpenMidLeft]Ugh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What a miserable situation this is.[A][NL]
How would my many many many many[NL]
many many many admirers at home feel[A][NL]
if they found out their favorite Hero of[NL]
Justice was captured by some no-name[....][NL]
bandits?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know whatcha mean.[....] If my teacher[NL]
saw me right now, she'd chew my ear off.[A][NL]
But hey,[....] at least we're not dead or[NL]
anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] she? So[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] is she[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
How should I word this[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Comforting on the eyes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Dear gods[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What? This is a very seroius concern![A][NL]
How can you focus on anything when you're[NL]
enarmored with a fair maiden's beauty?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]We're stuck in a jail cell,[NL]
unarmed, and lost![A][NL]
It doesn't matter if she's pretty, what[NL]
matters is how we can get out of here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh,[....] you're no fun.[NL]
But you're right.[A][NL]
[CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]But I failed her.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Come again?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]I failed Zo. I promised her that I'd[NL]
be the shield at her side. Always.[A][NL]
But I let her get captured, and to rub salt[NL]
in the wound, I got myself captured, too.[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]Some hero I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenMidRight]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]That's rough, buddy.[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes] (Oh gods, this is weird[ToggleMouthMove]...)[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes][NL]
I'm sure she's not disappointed.[A][NL]
Stuff happens, ya know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Rough does not even begin to describe it.[A][NL]
Knowing her, she's cowering in fear in[NL]
the corner of a cell, crying for help with[A][NL]
no one to answer her call. The thought[NL]
that I let that happen sickens me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It could be worse, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How could this possibly get any worse?[NL]
Enlighten me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Both of ya are alive, ain't ya?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I suppose that's true[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]And, if both of you are alive, then that[NL]
means we stand some chance, yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Ostrava[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] You're right![A][NL]
You're right; both of us are still alive, which[NL]
means we stand a chance to escape this[A][NL]
nightmare. I like your previous idea! Let's come[NL]
up with a plan to get the hell out of here![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]Oh, thank the gods--[....][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes] Er,[....] I mean, yeah![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Any ideas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, so I somewhat have an idea[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm willing to try anything.[A]
[OpenMidRight]First we call a guard, then break this[NL]
over his head.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Medicine? Where did you find this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I dunno. It was on the ground.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] oddly convenient.[NL]
Maybe luck truly is on our side.[A][NL]
Quite honestly, it's so spontaneous, I would[NL]
be surprised if you didn't remove it from your[A][NL]
own arse. [ToggleSmile]So all that is required of me is to[NL]
break this over one of those devils' heads?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Yeeeeep.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can surely do that much.[A][ToggleSmile][NL]
Ben Von Fatassaru is certainly capable of[NL]
shattering this vile against a brigand's[A][NL]
cranium just as a drunkard delivers blows[NL]
to his fellow boozers in a tavern brawl![A][X]

##Ch1ReinforcementWarning
[OpenMidRight][LoadYanik]I hear footsteps.[....] We should hurry.[A][X]

##Ch1EnemiesArrive
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBandit]Oi! The prisoners escaped![....][NL]
Get 'em, boys![A][X]

##Ch1BossQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOdarit]Eh?[....] How did you escape?[A][NL]
Well, no matter.[NL]
You won't go any further![A][X]

##Ch1BossQuoteYanik
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOdarit][OpenMidLeft]Well well well.[A][NL]
You must be the lad who was[NL]
making such a damn ruckus.[A][NL]
What say, boy?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadYanik][OpenMidRight]That'd be me.[A][NL]
Your boys have made the stupid[NL]
decision of taking my love[A][NL]
away from me.[....][NL]
This is just the beginning.[A][NL]
After I've seen the miniscule[NL]
shred of life leave your body,[A][NL]
I will kill every single bandit[NL]
here and torch this place to[A][NL]
the ground![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadOdarit][ToggleSmile]Ha![....] I like your fire, boy![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Let's see if you can back[NL]
those words with steel![A][X]

##Ch1Closing1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][OpenMidRight][LoadZo][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]*sob*[....] Ben![A][OpenMidRight][MoveLeft]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Zo![....] I would say I'm happy[NL]
to see you alive,[A][NL]
but I knew you could handle yourself.[NL]
You are my sidekick, after all![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Still[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] It is good to see you unharmed.[A]
[OpenRight][LoadOstrava]I'm fine too, thanks.[A]
[OpenLeft][OpenEyes][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadZo][OpenLeft]Sorry, Ostrava. Are you okay?[A]
[OpenRight]Eh,[....] I've been better. Glad to see[NL]
you're holding up alright.[A]
[OpenLeft]Thanks.[....] I couldn't stand being in that cell.[A]
[OpenRight]How'd you even get out?[NL]
We couldn't even--[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadYanik][OpenFarFarRight]Hey, I'm the one who saved them.[A][NL]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]The name's Yanik, your savior.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]I was going to say thanks, but you[NL]
don't have to be a nudge about it.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadJuli][OpenFarRight]Thank you for saving us, Yanik.[A]
[OpenLeft]Oh,[....] is this your partner?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Yes, quite impressive, isn't he?[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Uh,[....] I guess?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]A pleasure to make your acquaintances![A][NL]
I am[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft] THE MIGHTY Ben Von Fatassaru[NL]
Bringer of Chaos! Often known as Be--![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Just call him Ben.[NL]
I'm Zo.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]Bitch[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Hey![....] I don't want to stay here[NL]
for very long![A][NL]
I don't want to be captured[NL]
a second time today.[A][NL]
Or ever again, for that matter.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava]I'm Ostrava. You really[NL]
saved our skins back there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It was nothing, but I mainly[NL]
came here to free Juliana.[A]
[OpenFarRight]But Yanik, they helped[NL]
us fight off those bandits.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Alright, I guess you helped out a little.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'll admit,[....] you two got some chuzpah.[NL]
You wanna tag along with us?[A]
[OpenFarRight]I guess we could. It'd[NL]
be safer than going alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]Hey guys[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] We were looking[NL]
for a bandit hideout, right?[A]
[OpenFarRight]What do you mean?[NL]
Aren't we leaving?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen]I do believe you're right, Ostrava.[A][NL]
This contemptible hell hole we find[NL]
ourselves in is none other than[A][NL]
a bandit citadel![A][NL]
That means that the fair maiden[NL]
whom we seek must be within[A][NL]
its vile catacombs.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZo]To put what he said in English,[A][NL]
we were to go to the bandits' hideout[NL]
to save a merchant captured by them,[A][NL]
then we were captured ourselves[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
At least we made it.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Zo![....] I'm very disappointed in you.[A][NL]
Do you really take our new friends[NL]
as blubbering imbeciles?[A][NL]
I'm sure they understood[NL]
what I said perfectly fine.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenRight]No, she's right.[NL]
I didn't catch any of it.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadYanik][OpenMidRight]Yeah, me neither.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I see. Never mind that![A][NL]
With my help, your oration[NL]
patterns will mirror my own.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Do you need me[NL]
to translate again?[A]
[OpenRight]Whatever it is, it's not important[NL]
right now. We got a lady to save![A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Wow,[....] harsh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[OpenEyes]But the lad's right![NL]
[ToggleSmile]After me, comrades![A][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight][ToggleSmile][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ben, don't just charge in--[....]![NL]
And he's gone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Dear Merroi, he's going[NL]
to get himself killed.[A][NL]
We should hurry.[A]
[OpenRight]Right.[....] Let's go, everyone![A][X]
