##Chapter6Intro1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenLeft][LoadBen]My lady, pardon my asking, but how[NL]
close to the capital do we find[A][NL]
ourselves currently?[A]
[OpenRight]We are still quite a ways away, unfortunately.[NL]
A few more days journey.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Good.[....] It's been a while since I got to stretch[NL]
my legs like this. Long journeys like this[A][NL]
are a damn good workout.[A]
[OpenLeft]I admire your stamina, Forebringer of[NL]
Fortune, and I couldn't agree more. Long[A][NL]
journeys like this not only grow the body[NL]
and mind, but toughens the soul as well.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Speak for yourself. Even when I'm floating[NL]
like right now, my legs are killing me.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenLeft]Oh yes, how could I have forgotten?[A][NL]
You are a mage, and a tool in your magical[NL]
kit is the ability to rebel against gravity's[A][NL]
oppressive rule.[A]
[OpenRight]Regardless, we need to keep moving.[A][NL]
A large forest is up ahead, and it may take[NL]
us the whole day to traverse.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava]Why couldn't we just go around?[A]
[OpenRight]The forest is quite large, and trying to[NL]
travel around it would add an extra day[A][NL]
to the journey.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadJunpei][ToggleSmile]What, ya don't wanna head out on our[NL]
own turf, Osty? We do our best fighting[A][NL]
in the bush.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]It's not that, Ma. Something just feels[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
off.[A][X]

##Chapter6Intro2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]In my travels, I do believe I've been[NL]
through this forest. It starts here and[A][NL]
spans across many acres to the east.[NL]
There are small villages dotted about[A][NL]
within the greenery, but also bandits[NL]
who make its leafy embrace their home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava]Doesn't look like we can carve straight[NL]
through. If we go too deep in the[A][NL]
thicket, we're bound to get lost.[A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadJunpei][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]Oi, boy.[....] Do you hear that?[A][X]

##Chapter6Intro3
[OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier]There they are![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]N-Norwhickian soldiers?![A]
[OpenFarLeft]What?[....] This far beyond the border?[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes](They don't look like royal guards[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Still, why are they here?)[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenRight][LoadBen]Roshal?[....] What ever could you be mumbling[NL]
about?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Now isn't the time fer that; we need[NL]
to get ready to fight![A]
[OpenFarLeft]This bodes poorly, but I must agree.[NL]
Prepare for battle.[A][X]

##Chapter6Intro4
[OpenMidRight][LoadCiel]The next town should be nearby[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I can see it from here.[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] Hm?[A][NL]
Valentine, what's wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]You there![....] Stand down, now![A]
[OpenMidRight]Hey, put your weapons down.[NL]
I'm just passing through.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]This is military territory. Leave now, or[NL]
face the consequences.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Since when?[....][CloseEyes] Ah damn,[OpenEyes] I guess I can't convince[NL]
you to let me go? Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Val, get us out of here![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Men, stop her![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##CielRecruitment
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Hey, you up there! Down here![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCiel]Hm?[....] You don't look like a soldier from[NL]
Norwhick. Are you what they're after?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not quite. To be honest, I'm not sure what[NL]
exactly they're after, but they are[A][NL]
attacking us. Are they fighting you too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, I just wanted to fly over, but[NL]
they stopped and attacked me.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well then, at least for now, we're[NL]
on the same side. Might as well join[A][NL]
forces, don't you think?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'm sorry?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well, we'd have better odds of fighting[NL]
them off together, wouldn't we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I guess? [CloseEyes]I'm not sure[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]At the very least, you would be better[NL]
off in a group rather than alone.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]Yeah, that's true.[....] Okay, I'll bite.[NL]
My lance is yours. For now, anyway.[A][X]

##Chapter6Village1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadLittleGirl]I always thought we were far enough from[NL]
the border that we wouldn't be in danger[A][NL]
of any border skirmishes! I have a really[NL]
bad feeling about this. I'd make this[A][NL]
concoction in case someone came[NL]
down with a serious disease, but you[A][NL]
need this right now, in case anyone[NL]
gets hurt in the fighting. Go on, take it.[A][X]

##Chapter6Village2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadOldMan]And here I thought the most excitement we'd[NL]
ever see was hunting game deeper in the[A][NL]
forest, or maybe some bandits here or[NL]
there. There are some nasty critters[A][NL]
in there. Boars, bears, all the sort.[NL]
At least we don't get lions or other big[A][NL]
cats up here in Vernet. Here,[....] have this bow[NL]
I made. My daughter wanted a new one[A][NL]
for hunting deer, but you're fighting[NL]
something a bit sturdier than deer.[A][X]

##Chapter6House1
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadRedHead]This forest doesn't have any official name,[NL]
but we locals call it the Tiny Rouge Woods.[A][NL]
We call it that 'cause in the autumn, some of[NL]
the smaller trees' leaves turn a deep red[A][NL]
color. It's real pretty, 'specially at sunset.[NL]
Mighty dangerous, though. More[A][NL]
superstitious people like to think that the[NL]
leaves are stained red with the blood of[A][NL]
those who've passed.[A][X]

##Chapter6House2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadWoman]We've been trying to petition the government[NL]
to make a safe route through the forest[A][NL]
for years, but they never listend. Now look[NL]
what's happened. You need safe passage,[A][NL]
and both soldiers and bandits are coming[NL]
down on you. Maybe you'll think twice[A][NL]
about denying us common folk in the[NL]
future, hmm?[A][X]

##Chapter6BossBattleQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZygos][ToggleSmile]Ha ha! You've fallen for my[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
what's it called? Ah, right![A][NL]
My trap![A][X]

##Chapter6BossDeathQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZygos]B-But[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] my perfect[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
strategies[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter6Ending1
[OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne][ToggleMouthMove]....[....][ToggleMouthMove]Damn. What[NL]
is Norwhick doing all the way up here[ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I don't know, but if I had to[NL]
guess[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] They might be after land.[A]
[OpenRight]Land?[....] As in, they want to conquer Vernet?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]![....] Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] N-Not all of it,[NL]
I don't think.[A]
[OpenLeft]This is an act of war.[NL]
Border skirmishes are one thing,[A][NL]
but Norwhickian troops have outright[NL]
invaded Vernet.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] The king's not at fault here--![NL]
Erm, I don't think, anyway.[A][NL]
H-He wouldn't just defy the centuries of[NL]
peace like that![A]
[OpenFarRight]The boy's got a point. The nations've[NL]
been at peace for centuries.[A][NL]
I can't think of a reason why King Orion[NL]
would just invade with no declaration of war.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo]Then who's dispatching Norwhickian soldiers,[NL]
if not the king?[A]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]I don't know, lass. I just don't know.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenRight]Well, sitting around here thinking isn't going[NL]
to help much, that's for sure.[A]
[OpenLeft]I agree, we should keep moving.[A][NL]
At this rate, night is going to fall before we[NL]
leave the forest. I do not know how safe[A][NL]
it will be at night.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadBen][ToggleSmile]My apologies, dear Roshal, I'm afraid I'll[NL]
be taking over your navigation duties.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal]Oh![....] Uh, okay[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]My Lady Princess,[....][OpenEyes] you may rely on me to[NL]
giude you through Mother Nature's[A][NL]
maze of shadow.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Lead the way, young swordsman.[A][X]

##Chapter6Ending2
[OpenFarRight][LoadZo][OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenRight][LoadBen][OpenLeft][LoadOstrava][CloseEyes]By the gods, my feet are killing me.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarRight]Should we set up camp here?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh, if we do, I can hunt game for us.[A]
[OpenRight]And from this game, I will prepare[NL]
the gamiest meal you all have ever tasted.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]Ben, that's not a good thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenRight]What?[....] Why not?[A]
[OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]Gamey means it's spoiled.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]As you all will feel after dining upon my[NL]
decadent game stew![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes]Ms. Junpei, can you cook for us instead?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadJunpei]Aye, I could whip something up.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]I hope it's edible this time[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne]While you all do that, I can pitch tents.[NL]
The only thing I really can do here,[A][NL]
unfortunately.[A]
[OpenLeft][OpenEyes]I'll help ya out with that.[NL]
After dinner, we should probably call this[A][NL]
day over and get some sleep.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Hear, hear![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Sounds good. I'm getting tired.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We will march first thing in the morning,[NL]
so be sure you get enough sleep.[A][X]

##Chapter6Ending3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCiel][OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]Ah, I am sorry, I do not believe I know[NL]
you. How long have you been traveling[A][NL]
with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I just joined today, and I don't know[NL]
if I'm staying.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Why is that?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I was attacked by the same group as you.[NL]
I was going to leave after the battle,[A][NL]
but my wyvern's exhausted.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I am sorry to hear that. Is there nothing[NL]
I can do to convince you to stay,[A][NL]
Madame?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Erm[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Please don't call me that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Call you what? Madame?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]Yes,[....] I'm not a woman.[NL]
Or a man, for that matter.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, my apologies.[NL]
What is your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] You're just okay with that?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, of course. Why would I not be?[A][NL]
I have no reason to not respect your[NL]
wishes.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]No one has ever[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes][NL]
Um, my name is Ciel.[A][NL]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] And I wish to stay with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, well that is quite pleasing to hear.[A][NL]
Wyvern riders are quite uncommon in Vernet,[NL]
and I am sure your skills will be invaluable.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]My name is Jeanne. It is a pleasure[NL]
to meet you, Ciel.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's nice to meet you too. And this[NL]
is my wyvern, Valentine.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It is a pleasure to meet you too, Valentine.[A]
[OpenFarFarLeft]Roar![A][X]
