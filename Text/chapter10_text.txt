##Chapter10Intro1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]Alright, this is Irrithyl Fortress.[NL]
If Gotthard is anywhere, he is here.[A]
[OpenRight]We shouldn't just sit around.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Understood.[....] What's the plan now?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Keep pushing forward, lass?[A]
[OpenLeft]Indeed.[....] We must be quick.[A][NL]
I have no doubt in my mind Gotthard[NL]
has already called for reinforcements[A][NL]
to flank us, as Sir Ben said.[A]
[OpenRight]I'm concerned about the reinforcements[NL]
catching up.[A]
[OpenLeft]If all goes well, we will never see them.[A][NL]
If they do however, we will need to[NL]
fend them off while we confront Gotthard.[A]
[OpenFarRight]That's easier said than done, lass.[A]
[OpenLeft]I am aware, Junpei.[NL]
But we no longer have a choice.[A]
[OpenRight]There's no point talking about it.[NL]
Let's move in.[A][X]

##Chapter10Intro2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard][OpenFarRight][LoadRedSoldier][OpenRight][LoadRedSoldier]The Vernish force has made it to the[NL]
fortress gates, sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]Of course they have.[NL]
Because I'm surrounded by idiots.[A]
[OpenRight]What are our orders?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]What do you think we do?[NL]
We defend our fortress.[A][NL]
This land is the property of Norwhick now.[NL]
Treat this battle as though your own[A][NL]
homeland were being invaded! Am I[NL]
understood?[A]
[OpenRight]Yes sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Good.[NL]
Now get these damn soldiers off my land.[A]
[OpenFarRight]What about the reinforcements that you[NL]
called for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If they listened to my commands, they should[NL]
arrive shortly. [HalfCloseEyes]They won't escape.[A][X]

##VsGotthardOstrava
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]Are you Gotthard?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard]I am indeed Lord Gotthard.[NL]
And you are in my fortress.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]This isn't your fortress,[A][NL]
these lands belong to the[NL]
people of Vernet.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard]Not any longer.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidRight]Well then,[....] I'll just have to[NL]
take it from you,[A][NL]
six-piece chicken McNobody.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard][HalfCloseEyes]You can try, boy.[A][X]

##VsGotthardJeanne
[OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]Gotthard, I presume?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard]You presume correctly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]I am Jeanne, Princess of[NL]
Vernet. I will ask you to[A][NL]
get out of my land.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard]The Princess?[A][NL]
I hate to inform you, but you[NL]
lack any jurisdiction here.[A][NL]
The land is mine, and mine[NL]
alone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]Land stolen by force is[NL]
not rightfully owned.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard][OpenMidLeft]I think the victor decides who[NL]
does and does not own land.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]You assume you will win.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard][ToggleSmile]I will win, girl.[NL]
I will win quite easily.[A][X]

##VsGotthard
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard]You stand as invaders[NL]
into my territory.[A][NL]
Leave now, or die.[A][X]

##GotthardDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard]My[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] My land[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Damn you[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGotthard][OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]I hope all that trouble was worth it[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarRight]The opposing army is gone. We should[NL]
not need worry about any more foes.[A][NL]
All that is left is to bring Gotthard to[NL]
justice.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Justice?[....] I do not see any justice[NL]
here, you damn Vernish pests.[A]
[OpenFarRight]You conquered our land, and then try to[NL]
lecture me on the principle of justice?[A][NL]
Be silent, or your life will be further forfeit[NL]
than it already is.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Well, you're not exactly right, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And what do you mean by that, boy?[A]
[OpenRight]You said there's no justice here, ya?[NL]
I think there's plenty.[A][NL]
What's a better display of justice than[NL]
getting bopped by your own countrymen?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My own countrymen?[....][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft] Are you implying[ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenRight]You probably didn't catch it earlier.[A][NL]
Name's Ostrava, from Camlann province.[NL]
Norwhick.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Camlann[ToggleMouthMove]...?[....][ToggleMouthMove] Damn[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What[ToggleMouthMove]...?[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
No. It does not matter.[A][NL]
If you are from Norwhick, that simply[NL]
makes you a traitor.[A]
[OpenRight]Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.[A][NL]
What's a traitor to some flowery tart[NL]
that's somehow lost here, today.[A][NL]
To what is essentially a conglomerate[NL]
of idiots! [ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Er, no offense, Jeanne.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]No offense taken.[ToggleSmile][NL]
Now as for you, Gotthard.[A][OpenFarRight][MoveRight][NL]
[OpenRight]Would you like to be judged before[NL]
my father, the King of Vernet,[A][NL]
or your regent, the King of Norwhick?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]My Lord is a fair and just man,[NL]
and I'm sure he would--[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarFarLeft]I would...[....] what, exactly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]M-My Lord?[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOrion][OpenMidRight][LoadGotthard]Wh-What are you doing here, my King?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Gotthard,[....] Raime has informed me you were[NL]
gallivanting around in Vernish land.[A][NL]
Under whose authority have you committed[NL]
these acts for?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Y-Your Majesty, I was simply--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]And what, pray tell, were you simply doing?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] My[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] apologies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Will apologizing bring back the Vernish[NL]
lives you have taken away?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]No, my King.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Right.[....] Now then, you will be brought to the[NL]
capital, and be tried for your treason.[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenMidRight][LoadOrion]Now for you, Roshal. Why did you fail[NL]
to return to the capital?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Eep![....] Y-Your Majesty! I'm sorry, I got[NL]
separated from them when I went to go[A][NL]
scout for any threats. Then I was[NL]
surrounded, and captured by bandits.[CloseEyes] I[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[OpenEyes]I was rescued by these Vernish[NL]
people[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]I understand.[NL]
I am glad to see you unharmed.[A][NL]
Well come then, we must return home.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Okay. May[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
May I have a moment to say goodbye?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very well, lad.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava][OpenRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Princess Jeanne?[....][NL]
I'm sorry, but I have to go.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you, and everyone else, for keeping[NL]
me safe.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]I see. It is alright, Roshal.[NL]
Please, stay safe in Norwhick.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Alright then, pack up your things and[NL]
skedaddle. Just try not to get yourself[A][NL]
killed.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadBen][OpenRight][LoadZo][CloseEyes]Oh, I hate goodbyes.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]I hope we can see you again[NL]
sometime.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Roshal[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I don't know what to say.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Thank you. We couldn't have done[NL]
any of this without you.[A][NL]
Stay safe on your travels, okay,[NL]
navigator?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Ah, o-of course![NL]
Thank you, and goodbye.[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending4
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenLeft][LoadBen][OpenRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava][OpenRight]And now, finally, let us take our[NL]
leave to Reunere.[A]
[OpenFarRight]We're going to need at least a day[NL]
to get us all back to fighting form.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, I agree.[NL]
I'm both tired and sad now.[A]
[OpenRight]I suppose a day of respite here in[NL]
Irrithyl is acceptable.[A][NL]
We can leave at the crack of dawn.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I guess that's the best we'll get for now.[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending5
[OpenFarRight][LoadOldMan][OpenMidRight][LoadRedHead][OpenRight][LoadYoungWoman][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]It's them![A]
[OpenFarRight]You saved us![A]
[OpenMidRight]By the gods, thank you all so much![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Please, there is no need for thanks.[A][NL]
We are simply doing our duty[NL]
to our nation.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]Please, Princess,[OpenEyes] let me handle this.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Yes![....] It is us, the heroes![NL]
Don't worry however, we require no reward.[A][NL]
The simple statisfaction of a job well done[NL]
is enough for us![A][NL]
Just remember our names! Ben Von[NL]
Fatassaru, the Bringer of Chaos,[A][NL]
my valiant partner Zo, the Bringer of Truth,[NL]
and the rest of our merry party![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Actually, can we have a place to sleep?[NL]
Please?[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadOldWoman]Of course![A][NL]
I have an inn that was relatively[NL]
untouched by the battles that took place.[A][NL]
You can stay there as long as you need.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadOstrava]Thank you.[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending6
A few days later...[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending7
[OpenLeft][LoadZo][OpenMidLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen]So this is Reunere?[NL]
It feels as though it's missing something.[A]
[OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes]Describe "something."[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarLeft]I dunno![A][NL]
Maybe the spires could be taller, the[NL]
windows more pronnounced, just something.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Yes, well. Anyway, I will return shortly.[A][NL]
I need to get you all permission to stay[NL]
at the castle.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarFarRight][LoadBlueSoldier][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Finally![....][NL]
It's been weeks since I sent you two out.[A][NL]
What took you both so long to find the[NL]
Princess and the merchants?[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenLeft]Oh, well[ToggleMouthMove][CloseEyes]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry, but we were too late[NL]
to save the merchants.[A][NL]
When we arrived, they were all already dead,[NL]
and--[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
They're dead[ToggleMouthMove]...?[....][ToggleMouthMove] You[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] this is a joke, right?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Theoxia has checked them[N]
all in to the underworld, I'm afraid.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Oh gods, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Christophe[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] He can't be dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft][OpenEyes]I'm sorry, but we tried.[NL]
Are[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Will you be okay, sir?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Just go[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
You'll[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] get your pay later[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft]O-Okay[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] [CloseEyes]Let's go, Ben.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarFarRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[OpenMidRight]My apologies for taking so long. You should[NL]
now have free reign of the castle grounds.[A]
[OpenLeft]Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Thanks.[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending8
[OpenFarRight][LoadZo][OpenRight][LoadBen][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava]Alright, Princess, you've got us all together.[NL]
What do you want?[A]
[OpenLeft]Well, I have a proposition to make of you all.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Are you knighting us all? "Sir Ben,[NL]
Bringer of Chaos" has a nice ring to it![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Not exactly, I have spoken to my father[NL]
about the events of the past few weeks,[A][NL]
and he has seen fit to approve a[NL]
suggestion of mine.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Well? What's the suggestion?[A]
[OpenLeft]Should you choose to accept,[A][NL]
you will all be added to a new order in[NL]
the Vernish military, to be led by myself.[A][NL]
As an order against future incursions[NL]
and invasions.[A]
[OpenFarRight]So you wish to make us soldiers?[A]
[OpenLeft]Precisely.[A][NL]
You are all quite capable warriors in your own[NL]
rights, and I believe with proper pay and[A][NL]
equipment, you would do well under the[NL]
command of Vernet directly.[A][NL]
What do you all say?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]You want an answer right now?[A]
[OpenLeft]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I suppose asking for one right now[NL]
would be asking too much of you.[A][NL]
I do however implore you to consider.[A]
[OpenRight]Lady Jeanne, the mighty Ben Von[NL]
Fatassaru has spent the last three years[A][NL]
roaming Vernet with no purpose.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps joining your new divine order[NL]
is my purpose in this life.[A][NL]
If you think me worthy, I wholeheartedly[NL]
accept your offer![A][NL]
Zo, I'd be honored if my holy partner[NL]
would join me in this endeavor.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Well, I'd have to think on that,[NL]
but I'm leaning towards yes.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]I don't know. You're asking[NL]
a lot of me here, Princess.[A]
[OpenLeft]I understand, Ostrava.[NL]
Take all the time you think you will need.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Me[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] A soldier[ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][X]

##Chapter10Ending9
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][ToggleSmile]Thank you very much for playing![A][ToggleSmile][NL]
This concludes our second demo,[NL]
and we hope you are pleased.[A][NL]
Feel free to give us any and all[NL]
criticism in the thread,[A][NL]
so we can hopefully make our little[NL]
project even better.[A][X]
