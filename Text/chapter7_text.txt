##Chapter7Intro1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal][OpenMidRight]Um, hey. Is[Beat] Is everyone awake?[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadZo][HalfCloseEyes][OpenLeft]Not really[Beat] I just need to splash[NL]
water on my face first.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidLeft]Yeah[Beat] Yeah, I'm up.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft]I am as awake as the sun herself,[NL]
dear Roshal.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadJunpei][OpenLeft]I've been up for an hour, ya know.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenMidLeft]Yes, I am quite rested.[....][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile][MoveMidLeft] Someone needs to be [NL]
drafting a plan after all.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait[Beat] How long have you been[NL]
awake? And what plan?[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenFarRight]I don't even think the poor thing[NL]
slept. Looks like you've been[A][NL]
cracking for hours.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]Indeed. And we need a plan for[NL]
moving forward. So, I have been[A][NL]
devising our strategy for how we[NL]
move from now on.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft]Pray tell, what is this masterful[NL]
plan you've concocted, my lady?[A]
[OpenLeft]We cannot leave the nation vulnerable[NL]
to attack. We must find a way to[A][NL]
drive out the invading force before[NL]
we return to the capital.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight]You don't seriously think that a group[NL]
group as small as ours can fight off an[ANL]
entire army, do you?[A]
[OpenLeft]We do not know for certain the size[NL]
of the opposing host. I believe it[ANL]
would be best to do some[NL]
reconnaissance.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You[Beat] want to go scouting?[A]
[OpenLeft]This is what I'm saying, yes.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Yes, that is a superb idea![....][ToggleSmile] My lady,[NL]
If I may,[....][MoveFarLeft] I volunteer my eloquent[ANL]
stealth skills for this mission.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZo][HalfCloseEyes][OpenMidRight]Ben[Beat] You see that hunk of metal[NL]
on your head?[A]
[OpenEyes][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]You mean Heimdall?[....] What about him?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Who?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ah,[MoveMidLeft] how rude of me. I've failed to[NL]
introduce to you my partner, who's been[ANL]
by my side, or more accurately,[MoveMidLeft] on my head,[NL]
even longer than Zo. This fellow resting[ANL]
atop my crown is Heimdall. Heimdall was a[NL]
gift from my mother, she gave him to me[ANL]
before I departed on my travels.[ToggleSmile] Not only[NL]
does he protect my head,[MoveMidLeft][CloseEyes] but he is a[ANL]
constant reminder of home as well.[A]
[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]That thing makes a lot of noise, Ben.[NL]
You'll be noticed within seconds.[A]
[OpenEyes][OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenFarLeft]The plan is that we all scout together.[NL]
Our party is small enough that we are[ANL]
capable of getting around quietly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Strength in numbers ey, I see.[....][OpenEyes] Genius[NL]
as always my lady.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Is that sarcasm?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]Of course not. Merroi forbid their troops[NL]
see us. We have the firepower to dispel[ANL]
them.[A][MoveLeft]
[OpenFarLeft]If their troops saw us, that would[NL]
not be very successful scouting.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenFarRight][Beat]How are you all still alive?[A]
[OpenLeft][HalfCloseEyes]Hard work, dedication, and an ungodly[NL]
amount of luck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]Mostly the luck.[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][OpenLeft][OpenEyes][OpenFarLeft]Let us focus. A small scouting party[NL]
to discover who our foe is exactly,[ANL]
what they are doing here, and how[NL]
large their force is.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava][HalfCloseEyes][OpenFarRight]We could just look and walk forward.[NL]
[OpenEyes]I feel like you're overcomplicating[ANL]
this. We're going to a place, and I[NL]
have no doubt we'll run into trouble[ANL]
in one way or another. So why don't[NL]
we just go?[A]
[OpenLeft]That[Beat] Uh[Beat] works too[Beat][MoveLeft] Ahem![ANL]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]The Bringer of Chaos stands ever[NL]
at the ready for any plan of attack,[ANL]
whether it be offsensive,[....][MoveLeft] defensive,[....][MoveLeft][NL]
stealthy,[....][MoveLeft] brash,[....][MoveLeft] to me it matters not![A]
[OpenFarRight][Beat][A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenLeft][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, let's just go with Ostrava's plan.[A]
[OpenLeft][OpenFarLeft]If you all think so,[MoveFarLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile] then I am not one to[NL]
veto that idea.[OpenEyes][ToggleSmile] We shall keep moving[ANL]
forward, keeping our eyes open for[NL]
enemy forces.[A][X]

## Chapter7Intro2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadNatsumi][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Werecyn above, why are people so damn[NL]
superstitious?[....] Can't I just practice[NL]
my dark magic in peace?[A][MoveRight]
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal][OpenRight][OpenEyes][MoveRight]GAH![....][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenMidLeft]Wh-Where[MoveMidLeft] did you all come from?![A]
[OpenMidRight]Road.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I-[....][MoveMidLeft] Well,[....] I[....] suppose that makes sense.[NL]
You scared me, though.[....] Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Just travelers to the capital.[....] Don't[NL]
mind us we'll be on our way.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne]Indeed, it is as my friend has said.[NL]
Pay us no heed.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well hold on. You said you were[NL]
heading to the capital, yeah?[A]
[OpenMidRight][Beat]Yes. Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Well[Beat] It's just that there's been[NL]
trouble on the road lately.[A]
[OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]And let me guess, you want to come[NL]
with us because it's safer, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Not really, I was just gonna warn[NL]
you to be careful.[LoadOverworldFaces] If you're[ANL]
offering, though[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight]Would you be able to aid us in any way?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I have a certain talent for the arcane.[NL]
Though,[CloseEyes] not many seem to be willing[ANL]
to give me a chance.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadZo]I know not of curses,[....] but you'd have[NL]
lost yourself by now if you weren't[NL]
responsible.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][MoveMidLeft]Exactly! But some people just refuse[NL]
to listen! They go on and on about[ANL]
how I'm going to summon some crazy[NL]
abominations and kill everyone I[NL]
know what I'm doing dammit![A]
[OpenRight][MoveMidRight][OpenFarRight][MoveRight][OpenRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]Well, if no one else wants to listen[NL]
to reason,[OpenEyes] why not come with us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]If you'll take me,[OpenEyes] I'll join you.[NL]
My spells are pretty strong.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]Yeah,[....] fine,[....] okay.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You won't regret it![A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][OpenEyes][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarRight]Now then,[LoadOverworldFaces] you said something about[NL]
trouble on the road?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, soldiers.[....] I haven't heard[NL]
anything about where they might be[ANL]
from, but people have all told me[NL]
the same thing. Too heavily armed[ANL]
to be bandits, terrorizing the[NL]
countryside. amassing around the town[NL]
of Irrithyl.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Irrithyl?[....] That is not too terribly[NL]
far from here, maybe a two days[ANL]
travel.[CloseEyes][ToggleRed] This does not bode well[Beat][OpenEyes][NL]
[ToggleRed]And if I recall correctly, there[ANL]
is a well fortified stronghold near[NL]
here. If there are soldiers in the[ANL]
are, they have most certainly taken[NL]
that fortress.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadJunpei][OpenLeft]Need I remind you, lass there's only[NL]
a few of us.[....] We aren't exactly liable[NL]
to deal with a small army[A]
[OpenFarRight]Perhaps so, but I am the heir to[NL]
this nation.[....] I have a responsibility[NL]
to my people.[A]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]That you do.[OpenEyes][....] Just be mindful.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I understand.[....] We will be cautious.[NL]
If I do not think we can handle the[NL]
fight we shall not engage.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Alright then.[....][OpenEyes] Well what are we[NL]
standin' around for? Let's get movin'![A][X]

## Chapter7Intro3
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen]Is this the well fortified fortress[NL]
you spoke of,[....]Lady Jeanne?[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadZo][CloseEyes]Oh gods,[....][NL]
Not another one[Beat][A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne]Yes,[....][NL]
this should be it.[ANL]
Roshal, could you scout out the[NL]
building for us?[ANL]
We must know the number of enemy[NL]
forces before we engage them.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal]What?[.....][NL]
Oh, I[Beat][ANL]
I guess I can.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava]I'll go with 'im.[.....][NL]
Four eyes are better than two.[A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Okay.[Beat] I won't let you down.[A][X]

## Chapter7Intro4
[OpenLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal][OpenFarRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadOstrava][OpenRight]There's a lot of them,[NL]
I'm not sure about this.[A]
[OpenLeft]Can you give a concrete number?[A]
[OpenRight]Maybe[Beat] a couple dozen?[NL]
Might be more.[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]Hey, I saw them too. I think[NL]
we might have a chance.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Whether it be two dozen or[NL]
twenty dozen,[ANL]
the mighty Ben Von Fatassaru will[NL]
stand his ground.[ANL]
If my lady wills it, I will not hesitate[NL]
to run in, pot first.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenLeft]Hm. I appreciate the[NL]
vote of confidence,[ANL]
Sir Ben. You as well, Ostrava.[NL]
If you believe we can do this,[ANL]
then we shall make our move.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo]Alright then.[ANL]
Just make sure we don't find Ben's[NL]
corpse after all this.[A]
[OpenLeft]I promise you no harm[NL]
shall befall our ally, Lady Zo.[ANL]
Let us be off, then.[A][X]

## OhShitHeTurn3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMentle][OpenMidLeft]Theoxia above,[NL]
what in the hell is going on here?[ANL]
Are those Norwhick soldiers?[NL]
Dammit, Orion,[ANL]
even after all we suffered through…[NL]
Wait, who are those guys? [ANL]
They seem to be fighting the soldiers.[NL]
I suppose I'll offer my aid,[ANL]
see what they're up to later.[A][X]

## Wilstravatalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft][LoadMentle][OpenMidLeft]Hail axeman![A]
[OpenMidRight]No.[....] Please god no.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Peace, soldier, I mean you no harm.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Oh, I know.[NL]
No one that actually tries to[ANL]
talk to us does.[NL]
Whatcha want?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are those Norwhick soldiers?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Seems like it, yeah.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That's in direct violation of the accords.[NL]
Damn,[....] I knew something was up.[A]
[OpenMidRight]This whole thing is really starting[NL]
to look out of our league[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]Seems like it.[....] Say,[NL]
you mind if I help you rout these guys?[ANL]
Their general seems incredibly strong[NL]
for you guys to take on.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Sure I guess,[NL]
what's the catch?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nothing at all.[NL]
Just doing my part to keep the peace.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's[Beat] a rather good answer. Have at it, then.[A][X]

## Willeannetalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJeanne][OpenMidRight][LoadMentle][OpenMidLeft]Hello?[NL]
Who might you be?[ANL]
You do not seem to be in[NL]
allegiance with these invaders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]You would be correct, Princess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You're aware of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Louis would never shut up about his[NL]
"cute"[....], "little"[....] daughter.[ANL]
I suppose from your attire[ANL]
that you were the one.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes][Beat] Who are you?[ANL][OpenEyes]
You are clearly close enough
to my father that you would[ANL]
refer to him by his given name,
yet I have no memory of you.[ANL]
And you don't speak with a
Vernish accent either.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I say we get to formal introductions
after we finish fighting these soldiers.[ANL]
I promise that all will be explained then.[ANL]
Sounds good to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Very well.
However, I will keep an eye on you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I'd be disappointed and
concerned if you didn't.[A][X]

## Alfredbossquote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlfred]Damn fools,[NL]
don't know when you're beaten![A][X]

## WilvAlf
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlfred]YOU?![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadWil]Yeah,[....] me.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlfred]What in the blazes are you doing here?
Gotthard said you were retired![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMentle]Well, technically I am,
but when I see some hotshot noble[ANL]
and his private army waltz into the
opposing country stealing land without[ANL]
consent, I'm kinda obligated[NL]
to get off my ass and handle it.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlfred]Dammit all,[....] Gotthard said this
would be a simple takeover![A][X]


## AlfredDeathQuote
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlfred]This is[N]

## bostchapter
[OpenMidRight][LoadWil][OpenMidRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]Oi oi, hold up Mr. Snazzy pants,[NL]
I got a question.[....] Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadWil][OpenMidLeft]Ah, yes, of course.[ANL]
My name is William.[....][NL]
I'm a peacekeeper of sorts.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarRight]William?[....] As in, Sir William?[....] Truly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I haven't heard someone[NL]
call me "Sir" for quite some time[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]Your name carries a lot of history[NL]
and renown, even here in Vernet.[A]
What is the famous Norwhickian war[NL]
hero doing up here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I saw some Norwhick soldiers[NL]
pass through the town I'm living in,[ANL]
so I went to investigate,[NL]
and I saw you guys fighting with them,[ANL]
so I decided to help out.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadRoshal]My gods… S-Sir William?![....] I-It's an honor... sir![A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's a pleasure to meet you as well.[ANL]
Your bow arm is quite strong,[NL]
from what I could witness.[A]
[OpenFarRight]O-[....]Oh![....] Well, um[Beat] thank you, sir![A][ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne][CloseEyes]To keep things on topic,[ANL][OpenEyes]
there is something bothering me[NL]
about all that.[....] The man we fought...[ANL]
He was stronger than anyone[NL]
we have seen up until this point.[ANL]
There was a strong air[NL]
of nobility to him.[ANL]
Do you know anything about him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I do.[.....][NL]
He was the commander[ANL]
of the private army of one of[NL]
Norwhick's nobles.[A]
[OpenRight]Alright,[....] who is he working for?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I heard him call out the name[....] Gotthard.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Gotthard?[.....][NL]
I have not heard that name before.[ANL]
He is a noble of Norwhick, you say?[NL]
[CloseEyes]That does not bode well.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadJunpei][OpenRight]What're ya thinking there, lass?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenFarLeft][LoadNatsu]Something dangerous and insane,[....] I'm sure.[A]
[OpenFarRight]We need to march on to Irrithyl,[ANL]
and push this noble out of Vernet,[NL]
by whatever means necessary.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava]You're ignoring the fact that there[NL]
aren't that many of us.[ANL]
I don't think we're this capable.[A]
[OpenRight]I agree with my boy.[ANL]
We have won some scuffles,[NL]
that we have, but that's small latkes[ANL]
compared to an organized, funded,[NL]
and properly trained unit.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen]Numbers need not be a concern[NL]
when you have such capable fighters[ANL] 
such as Zo and myself by your side![ANL]
Zo burns through those shit-stained invaders,[NL]
while the mighty Ben Von Fatassaru makes[ANL]
their hideous green armor run red [NL]
with his precise swor--[CloseSpeechFast]
[OpenLeft]Peace, lad.[ANL]
If you're heading towards Irrithyl,[NL]
head northeast from here.[ANL]
It's a little ways beyond the[NL]
Spirale River crossing.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Indeed.[....] It is not far.[....] We can drive them out.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][Beat]This is really really stupid,[ANL]
but I honestly don't think[NL]
there's anything else we can do.[A]
[OpenRight]If the only way to the city is beyond[NL]
the river crossing, we should[ANL]
expect a fight there.[.....][NL]
No doubt they'll want to defend the point.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Understood.[ANL]
We would do well to prepare for a fight, then.[NL]
Sir William, if I may?[ANL]
[OpenLeft]May I ask what it is you need?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Your skill with the axe is legendary.[A]
We could use a champion like you
in the fights ahead.[A]
[OpenLeft]Unfortunately, I am unable to[NL]
accompany you.[ANL]
I am riding towards Reunere to[NL]
inform Louis of this incursion.[ANL]
He will most likely send troops to help you.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I understand.[....] Hopefully my father[NL]
will dispatch troops quickly.[ANL]
I just pray that this does not end in a full war.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I agree with this.[....][NL]
It would be best to not start a war.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal]Um[Beat] Yeah![....] Yeah,[....] let's not[Beat][A]
[OpenFarRight]Then we ride out.[ANL]
We must make it to Irrithyl as[NL] 
soon as possible.[A][X]
