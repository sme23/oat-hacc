##NarrationPrologue
It's been a few weeks since I[NL]
skiddled from home, and every[A][NL]
day I regret leaving more and more.[NL]
Living in a dusty old tavern in[A][NL]
Trisdam was a hell of a lot better[NL]
than this. Anything is better than[A][NL]
this. Well...[....] there's no point[NL]
crying about it. If I keep looking,[A][NL]
something will come up.[A][X]

##NarrationChapter1
What started as the best day[NL]
has slowly turned into the worst.[A][NL]
After my run-in with Ben and Zo,[NL]
we ended up getting caught by[A][NL]
bandits. I feel like an idiot, and[NL]
this slip may end up being what[A][NL]
screws me. The mongrels threw us[NL]
in cells. Ben and I in one, and I'm[A][NL]
not even sure where they put Zo.[A][NL]
There's nothing left to do now but[NL]
think about an escape plan...[A][X]

##NarrationChapter2
Thanks to our new horse-bound[NL]
friends, we're finally free.[A][NL]
Thankfully, it seems that our unfortunate[NL]
imprisonment happened to be run of[A][NL]
good luck. This seems to be the place[NL]
they took the merchant girl.[A][NL]
We plan to push forward, hopefully[NL]
to victrory.[A][X]

##NarrationChapter3
Progress through the fort has been[NL]
steady, though rather confusing.[A][NL]
With the aid of Roshal, we have an[NL]
idea of where we're going, but I[A][NL]
doubt it'll make things easier.[A][X]

##NarrationChapter4
I hate this stupid building.[A][NL]
Whoever designed this accursed[NL]
place can burn in proverbial hell.[A][NL]
I feel like we've been walking for[NL]
days, and it's been maybe two hours.[A][NL]
The second we find whoever it is, I'm[NL]
jumping out the godsdamn window.[A][NL]
Roshal said we're almost to where he[NL]
saw her, so the suffering will end soon.[A][X]
