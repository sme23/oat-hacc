##Chapter2Opening1
[OpenMidRight][LoadYanik][OpenRight][LoadJuli][OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Alright, any ideas on what to do next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, that's obvious, isn't it? We look[NL]
for that person you're after, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, that's true.[....] I'm not exactly[NL]
sure where we're going,[A][NL]
but we should probably find a[NL]
way to sneak around here.[A]
[OpenRight]Well,[....] after a fine display of combat[NL]
prowess, I don't think we have[A][NL]
the luxury of sneaking in.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft]The lass is right![NL]
Stealth isn't a viable choice,[A][NL]
not that such a tactic was needed[NL]
in the first place, with the Chaos[A][NL]
Bringer by your side![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZorua][OpenMidRight]Ben, shut![....] Someone's coming.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Huh?[....] Oh, right. Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft] AHEM![NL]
STAND BACK![A][NL]
I SHALL PROTECT YOU FROM THESE[NL]
DETESTIBLE VERMIN!!![A][X]

##Chapter2Opening2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][LoadZorua][OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]AAAH![....] Stay back![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Still your blade for a moment, Ben![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Huh?[....] Oh, I see. You're not[NL]
one of those hooligans, are you?[A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]Hmmm...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Now that I look at you, you[NL]
don't appear to be a threat,[A][NL]
you look five years my junior.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Shame[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I so desperately wanted[NL]
to cleave a bitch in twain![A]
[OpenMidRight]Wh-What[ToggleMouthMove]...?[....][ToggleMouthMove] Wait, you aren't[NL]
going to recapture me?[A][NL]
Well,[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] out of my way![NL]
If I stay here too long[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Slow down a bit. What's going on? You[NL]
don't look like you're supposed to be here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I'd rather not stay for very long, but I[NL]
was brought here by brigands[A][NL]
and they took my weapons. I just[NL]
escaped and got them back,[A][NL]
but they're after me! They can't[NL]
be far behind either[ToggleMouthMove]...[A]
[OpenFarFarRight]THERE HE IS![A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadZorua][OpenMidLeft]Well![....] Your security was terrible.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft]It truly was.[A][NL]
Then again, no prison known to man[NL]
or manakete can keep the mighty[A][NL]
Ben Von Fatassaru contained[NL]
for ve--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ya little rats! I'll skin ye alive.[NL]
Get 'em, boys![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]

to finish a line[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadOstrava][OpenMidRight][LoadYanik][OpenMidRight]So what's the plan now?[NL]
I say we--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Fight first, plan later?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Fine, fight first it is![A]

Ben Von Fatassaru will protect you[A][NL]
from these detestable marauders![A][NL]
Provide cover fire if you can, okay?[A]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadZorua][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Just shut up, Ben[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Roshal.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Okay, Roshal. Do you mind giving us[NL]
a hand here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm trying. I just don't want[NL]
to get near those brigands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Why would you get close?[NL]
Plan to smack 'em with your quiver?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] It's why I'm back here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't go too far back. We need[NL]
to have a chat when this is over.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Why me?![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]I ask myself that every day...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How is that supposed to help?[NL]
Why do you need me?[A]

[OpenMidLeft]That yellow-bellied boy got outta his cell.[NL]

##Chapter2ElizabethRecruitment
[OpenMidRight][LoadJuli][OpenMidLeft][LoadElizabeth][OpenMidLeft]Pretty[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] All the better to cut to pieces...[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[....] Who's cutting who up now?[A][NL]
Are you an elite member of[NL]
this band of thieves?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elite? I guess you could say I am.[A][NL]
Though it's not like I give a shit about these[NL]
extras anyway. They're a means to an end.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's awful! Even if they only exist to[NL]
serve a purpose, they're still your comrades![A][NL]
And if not, then you maybe need better[NL]
hobbies than killing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Killing is all I know.[....] It serves my[NL]
purpose, and that purpose is revenge.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]That's even worse![....] Find something else![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]Why you![A][NL]

[OpenMidRight]Juliana. What's it to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Elizabeth, and I wish to join you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fine.[....] Maybe this way you can put[NL]
your skills to use and find something to do[A][NL]
other than make due on your vendetta.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##Chapter2GenericBossQuote

##Chapter2BossVsElizabeth

##Chapter2Ending1
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][OpenFarRight][LoadZorua][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Is everyone alright?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]But of course, my friend![A][OpenEyes][NL]
The Chaos Bringer struck through their[NL]
forces like a lumberjack through a tree![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]We're fine, but I'm not sure how[NL]
much longer we can keep this up.[A][NL]
Be more careful, Ben.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Pish Posh! The almighty Chaos Bringer[NL]
has no use for caution. These mongrels[A][NL]
don't stand a chance against my blade![A]
[OpenFarRight][HalfCloseEyes](I don't even want to argue.[NL]
Please keep an eye on him.)[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]How about you, Blondie?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal]Who, me? Y[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Yeah, I'm okay.[NL]
Y-You wanted me to stick around, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did. Can I ask you some questions?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[....][ToggleMouthMove]I guess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You broke out of here, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, why else would I[NL]
be in such a horrible place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, no need to be so snippy. I just[NL]
wanna know if you saw anyone else.[A][NL]
Did ya?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I'm not?[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] Ah, sorry. Yes I did.[NL]
I was being held near this woman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] That might be the gal[NL]
we're looking for. Which way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This way.[NL]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Why are you looking for her?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh,[....] I dunno, actually. I'm just rolling with it.[NL]
Zo,[....] why were you guys looking for her?[A][NL]
I'm all for good deeds, but she's just a[NL]
merchant.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft]Ahh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry we've been[NL]
dragging you along on this,[A][NL]
but it's important we save her.[NL]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] can't say anything more, though.[A][NL]
If she permits us, then we can tell[NL]
you the rest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]You can't say anything about it at all?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Not really. We were asked not to[NL]
say anything more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. It's not that I don't believe ya,[NL]
but this is all a little hard to take in.[A][NL]
I can't even know the name of the[NL]
person we're looking for?[A][NL]
Regardless[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I think I'll keep helping.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Now that the fray is behind us,[NL]
I must inquire. By what do you[A][NL]
go by, my new faint-hearted friend?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! Uh, my name's Roshal.[NL]
Do you still need me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't make decisions for you.[A][NL]
We can't keep you here, but you are pretty[NL]
good with that bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes] O-Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes] uh, thanks[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'd really like to help, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I don't[NL]
know if I should[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
But if you hadn't helped me, I'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not going to pressure you into doing[NL]
something you ain't comfortable with.[A][NL]
The choice is yours.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseEyes]........[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes] I'll stay.[NL]
Just please don't make me lead.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]'Tis not a bother, Roshal.[A][NL]
The best of captains need the finest of[NL]
navigators, and I happen to be an[A][NL]
amazing captain and I wager you're[NL]
an amazing navigator. Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft]He's saying he trusts you can show[NL]
us where she is.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Wha--[....] Uh, y-yes. Essentially.[A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Oh,[....] right. I just hope we won't run[NL]
into too much trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Somehow I doubt we won't.[A][X]

##Chapter2Ending2
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft][LoadElizabeth]...Hey, you the leader of this group?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I suppose I am.[NL]
Why, did you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm coming with you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Oh, okay.[....] You can fight, then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It's the only thing I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Why?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just wanna make sure you aren't[NL]
in any danger while we're searching[A][NL]
for this woman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I won't be. If anything, these extras will.[NL]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] point me at who you want dead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Uhh[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]
