##Chapter2Opening1
[OpenMidRight][LoadYanik][OpenRight][LoadJuli][OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Alright, any ideas on what to do next?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Well, that's obvious, isn't it? We look[NL]
for that person you're after, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, that's true.[....] I'm not exactly[NL]
sure where we're going,[A][NL]
but we should probably find a[NL]
way to sneak around here.[A]
[OpenRight]Well,[....] after a fine display of combat[NL]
prowess, I don't think we have[A][NL]
the luxury of sneaking in.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]The lass is right![NL]
Stealth isn't a viable choice,[A][NL]
not that such a tactic was needed[NL]
in the first place, with the Chaos[A][NL]
Bringer by your side![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZo][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Ben, shut![....] Someone's coming.[A]

Well,[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] out of my way![NL]

[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Slow down a bit. What's going on? You[NL]
don't look like you're supposed to be here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ah, I'd rather not stay for very long, but I[NL]
was brought here by brigands[A][NL]
and they took my weapons. I just[NL]
escaped and got them back,[A][NL]
but they're after me! They can't[NL]
be far behind either[ToggleMouthMove]...[A]

Plan to smack 'em with your quiver?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]N-No[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] It's why I'm back here.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadJuli][OpenMidLeft][LoadReno][ToggleSmile]Howdy-ho, lady![ToggleSmile][NL]
Question,[....] how would you like to die today?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not at all, preferably![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Truly?[....] I have many different ways of death,[NL]
each equally more painful than the last![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Ever been disemboweled?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, and I'd prefer to keep it that way![NL]
That shit's messed up![A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]I KNOW, RIGHT?[NL]
That's why it's great![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Is that why you're here? Just to get[NL]
some weird ass killing fix fulfilled?[A]

You don't seem to hold any allegiance to[NL]
these people.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] That just might work out in[NL]
my favor.[A][X]

##Chapter2Ending1
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][OpenFarRight][LoadZo][OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Is everyone alright?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]But of course, my friend![A][OpenEyes][NL]
The Chaos Bringer struck through their[NL]
forces like a lumberjack through a tree![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]We're fine, but I'm not sure how[NL]
much longer we can keep this up.[A][NL]
Be more careful, Ben.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Pish Posh! The almighty Chaos Bringer[NL]
has no use for caution. These mongrels[A][NL]
don't stand a chance against my blade![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes](I don't even want to argue.[NL]
Please keep an eye on him.)[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]How about you, Blondie?[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal]Who, me? Y[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Yeah, I'm okay.[NL]
Y-You wanted me to stick around, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I did. Can I ask you some questions?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]......[....][ToggleMouthMove]I guess.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You broke out of here, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yeah, why else would I[NL]
be in such a horrible place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hey, no need to be so snippy. I just[NL]
wanna know if you saw anyone else.[A][NL]
Did ya?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I'm not?[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] Ah, sorry. Yes I did.[NL]
I was being held near this woman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Woman[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] That might be the gal[NL]
we're looking for. Which way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]This way.[NL]
Wait[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Why are you looking for her?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Uh,[....] I dunno, actually. I'm just rolling with it.[NL]
Zo,[....] why were you guys looking for her?[A][NL]
I'm all for good deeds, but she's just a[NL]
merchant.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenFarLeft]Ahh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry we've been[NL]
dragging you along on this,[A][NL]
but it's important we save her.[NL]
We[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] can't say anything more, though.[A][NL]
If she permits us, then we can tell[NL]
you the rest.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]You can't say anything about it at all?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Not really. We were asked not to[NL]
say anything more.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I see. It's not that I don't believe ya,[NL]
but this is all a little hard to take in.[A][NL]
I can't even know the name of the[NL]
person we're looking for?[A][NL]
Regardless[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I think I'll keep helping.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Now that the fray is behind us,[NL]
I must inquire. By what do you[A][NL]
go by, my new faint-hearted friend?[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]Oh! Uh, my name's Roshal.[NL]
Do you still need me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I can't make decisions for you.[A][NL]
We can't keep you here, but you are pretty[NL]
good with that bow.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh?[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes] O-Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes] uh, thanks[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'd really like to help, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I don't[NL]
know if I should[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
But if you hadn't helped me, I'd be[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm not going to pressure you into doing[NL]
something you ain't comfortable with.[A][NL]
The choice is yours.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][CloseEyes]........[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes] I'll stay.[NL]
Just please don't make me lead.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]'Tis not a bother, Roshal.[A][NL]
The best of captains need the finest of[NL]
navigators, and I happen to be an[A][NL]
amazing captain and I wager you're[NL]
an amazing navigator. Am I wrong?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenFarLeft]He's saying he trusts you can show[NL]
us where she is.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Wha--[....] Uh, y-yes. Essentially.[A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Oh,[....] right. I just hope we won't run[NL]
into too much trouble.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Somehow I doubt we won't.[A][X]

##Chapter2Ending2
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft][LoadReno][ToggleSmile]Howdy-hi! You the leader of these people?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I suppose I am.[NL]
Why, did you need something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm here to stab people for you![A]
[OpenMidRight]O-Oh, okay.[....] You can fight, then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]That was implied.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I just wanna make sure you aren't[NL]
in any danger while we're searching[A][NL]
for this woman.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Nope![....] Just point me at who you want dead![A]
