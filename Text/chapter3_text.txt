##Chapter3IntroPt1
[OpenMidRight][LoadRoshal][OpenFarRight][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Geez,[....] who designed this place? It's like a[NL]
box, in a box, inside of forty other boxes.[A]
[OpenFarRight]And those forty boxes have cells[NL]
everywhere?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, and it's frustrating as sin![A][NL]
Roshal, are you sure this is the right[NL]
way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not really.[....] I thought I was at[NL]
first, but now I'm not certain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Uggggggggh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes]It's fine. We'll just figure[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] something[NL]
out.[A][X]

##Chapter3IntroPt2
[LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] hi there?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadGlazette][OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Is someone there?[A][NL]
I heard you call out and there were other[NL]
footsteps. Are you alone?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]No, I'm not alone. There are a few[NL]
of us here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft]What's this I see? A fair maiden trapped[NL]
in a cell, helpless?[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile] (Psst![....] Zo![....] Zo!)[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZorua][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Huh?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]This is our big moment to prove[NL]
we're not some walking punchlines[A][NL]
with weapons to these guys.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ohh,[....] I get it![A][X]

##Chapter3IntroPt3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen]That's--[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarFarRight][LoadGlazette][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Do I smell fire? Did someone burn[NL]
something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]There.[....] You're free to go.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, thank you. Are any of you wounded?[A][NL]
I can't do much besides heal, but[NL]
I would quite like to thank you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]No, we're all unwounded.[NL]
Can you stand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I can stand.[....] Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Ostrava, and these are my[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] friends?[NL]
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Glazette; I am a cleric from the[NL]
Church of Merroi. I was on a mission trip,[A][NL]
when I was captured by these wayward[NL]
souls about a week ago.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lucky break, then. Think you can[NL]
get out yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] no, I cannot. My sight is gone, you see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] guys?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually,[....] I would like to help you. I may not[NL]
have my vision, but I can still heal you.[A][NL]
And we are sure to find more of these[NL]
brigands as we try and escape.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have a good point[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Well, fine,[NL]
you can come along with us until[A][NL]
we finish here. How does that[NL]
sound?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can accept those terms.[NL]
Under my staff, you wiil not die.[A][X]

##Chapter3IntroPt4
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft][LoadRoshal][OpenMidLeft]A courtyard[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft] Now I remember! I went[NL]
through here while trying to escape.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Which way did you come from?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]From the[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] north, I think.[A][NL]
I remember taking a turn before finding[NL]
the courtyard, then I ran through.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft]Guys,[....] we've got company.[NL]
There are guards here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Darn it all.[....][OpenEyes] You said north, right?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] where all those bandits are[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][OpenMidLeft]Everyone! Break for the north![A][NL]
Come, Ostrava! Let us cut a path to[NL]
victory![A][2NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Well,[....] that's the way we gotta go, then.[NL]
Onward![A][OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Ben![....] Ostrava![....] Don't just--[....]![A][NL]
[CloseEyes]Ah, never mind[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidRight][LoadGlazette][OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes] Glazette, was it? Just make[NL]
sure they don't get themselves killed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I will do as I must.[A][X]

##IncomingReinforcements
[OpenMidRight][LoadKendrick][OpenMidRight]Damn it all![....] Where are those damn[NL]
reinforcements?[A][X]

##Chapter3BossBattleQuote

##Chapter3EndingDialogue
[LoadOstrava][OpenMidRight][LoadGlazette][OpenLeft][LoadBen][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]And that's what you Gib-faced foozlers[NL]
deserve![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright Ben, simmer down. Are you alright,[NL]
Glazette? That was quite the battle.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I am unscathed, thanks to all of[NL]
you. What about everyone else?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadZorua]Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.[A][NL]
[OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft]Just please stop charging in like[NL]
that. You're becoming as bad as Ben.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]It is as I've said all along![....] Any man or[NL]
woman whom treats themselves to[A][NL]
quality time spent with yours truly,[NL]
will sooner or later adopt his ways.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]No, I agree with the young mage.[NL]
I can only heal so much.[A][NL]
Please, be more careful![A]
[OpenRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Everything seems to be in[NL]
order. Where to next, Roshal?[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadRoshal]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Past this pillar, there's a[NL]
corridor that leads to where I was held.[A][NL]
The bandits call it some sort of throne[NL]
room.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What kind of bandit hideout has[NL]
a throne room?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadBen][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Only the best of them![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes]You wish![A]
[OpenFarRight]Regardless, we should keep moving.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]O-Okay.[....] This way.[A][X]
