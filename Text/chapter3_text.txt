box, in a box, inside of forty other boxes.[A]
[OpenFarRight]And those forty boxes have cells[NL]
everywhere?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, and it's frustrating as sin![A][NL]
Roshal, are you sure this is the right[NL]
way?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Not really.[....] I thought I was at[NL]
first, but now I'm not certain.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Uggggggggh.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]

footsteps. Are you alone?[A]

in a cell, helpless?[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile] (Psst![....] Zo![....] Zo!)[A]

something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]There.[....] You're free to go.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, thank you. Are any of you wounded?[A][NL]
I can't do much besides heal, but[NL]
I would quite like to thank you.[A]

Can you stand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I can stand.[....] Who are you?[A]

when I was captured by these wayward[NL]
souls about a week ago.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lucky break, then. Think you can[NL]
get out yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] no, I cannot. My sight is gone, you see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] guys?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually,[....] I would like to help you. I may not[NL]
have my vision, but I can still heal you.[A][NL]
And we are sure to find more of these[NL]
brigands as we try and escape.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have a good point[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Well, fine,[NL]
you can come along with us until[A][NL]

through here while trying to escape.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Which way did you come from?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]From the[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] north, I think.[A][NL]
I remember taking a turn before finding[NL]
the courtyard, then I ran through.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x103][OpenFarLeft]Guys,[....] we've got company.[NL]
There are guards here.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Darn it all.[....][OpenEyes] You said north, right?[A]

My guileful, cunning, and unmatched strength[NL]
will guard you from Evil's spiteful agents[A][NL]
as you make your escape![A][2NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveFarFarRight][OpenFarFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft]Well,[....] that's the way we gotta go, then.[NL]

I can only heal so much.[A][NL]
Please, be more careful![A]

[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x108]Um[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Past this pillar, there's a[NL]
corridor that leads to where I was held.[A][NL]
The bandits call it some sort of throne[NL]
room.[A]
