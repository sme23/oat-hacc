##Chapter5Intro1
[OpenRight][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenRight]It feels good to finally be back in[NL]
civilization.[A]
[OpenFarRight]We have arrived then. Trisdam, you[NL]
said it was called?[A]
[OpenRight]Yeah, this is it. Kinda dingy, I know, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
it's home. There's someone here who[A][NL]
can keep us safe for tonight.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]And who might that be?[A]
[OpenRight]My mentor. She's a local hero of sorts,[NL]
and if anyone can help us, it's her.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Your mentor? So, teacher then?[A]
[OpenRight]More or less, yes.[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadBen][CloseEyes]Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] At last I can gaze upon the beauty[NL]
of Ostrava's darling mentor,[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]the fair maiden who takes innocent[NL]
youths under her divine wings and[A][NL]
trains them into proud warriors.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Well, it will be nice to have a[NL]
friendly face to greet us.[A]
[OpenRight]Friendly is one way to put it.[NL]
This way, y'all. Should be close by.[A][X]

##Chapter5Intro2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenLeft][LoadOstrava]Well,[....] here we are.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Where is[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] "here?"[A]
[OpenLeft]My mentor's home. Let's just hope she's here.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidRight][OpenFarFarRight][LoadJunpei]Wha--?[....] Ah, the door.[NL]
I'll be right there.[A][LoadOverworldFaces][NL]
[OpenMidRight][MoveLeft][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight]Huh?[....][ToggleSmile] Osty! My sweet shawarma![NL]
And here I was, thinking you'd be gone[A][NL]
fer good, ya nudnik.[A]
[OpenLeft]Evening, Ma.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]M-MA?! You mean to tell me this[NL]
mentor of yours is your mother?![A]
[OpenLeft]More or less, yeah.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadZo]Um,[....] hello?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Well well, what've we got here? You've[NL]
gone and gotten yourself a posse.[A]
[OpenRight][LoadOstrava]Yes, I have.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]I apologize, but I do not have a name for[NL]
you. What should we call you?[A]
[OpenFarRight]The name's Junpei. And y'all are?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Allow me to introduce myself![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I am[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft] BEN VON FATASSARU,[NL]
BRINGER OF CHAOS,[A][NL]
OFTEN KNOWN AS BEN,[NL]
AND OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE[A][NL]
BENTANATOR. AND THIS[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadZo][OpenFarLeft] IS MY[A][NL]
PARTNER ZO! FEAR HER MIGHT![A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove] Ben the only reason why I let you[NL]
finish is because I'm really tired. Can we--[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Ha![....] I like your chutzpah, kid! Ya called[NL]
yourself Ben, right?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]At your service, 'o progenitor of prodegies.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarRight]If I wasn't retired, I'd put ya through[NL]
training regimen.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile][ToggleMouthMove].......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]Getting us back to the matter at hand[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][CloseEyes]Thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]
[OpenLeft]We need a place to stay for the night.[NL]
We're marching to the capital.[A]
[OpenFarRight]And who might you be, lass?[A]
[OpenLeft]I am Jeanne.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Jeanne, eh? Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Fancy.[A][NL]
Well, I suppose if my boy brought you here,[NL]
you're good folk. You can stay the night,[A][NL]
and you'll catch me up in the morning.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadBen]Thank you ever so, 'o trainer of warriors.[NL]
The bounds of your kindness reach[A][NL]
farther than the very stars that bless[NL]
our sacred meeting tonight.[A]
[OpenRight]Thanks, Ma. We've got some guest rooms;[NL]
you guys can hang in those.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo]Thanks, Ostrava, and thank you, Junpei.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Indeed, thank you greatly.[A][X]

##Chapter5Intro3
[OpenLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenFarFarLeft][LoadYoungMan][OpenFarFarLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]Junpei please! You must come quickly![NL]
Someone's come to raid the village![A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]What? Who?[....] Bandits?[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo]Not them again. I thought we dealt with[NL]
them?[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadYoungMan]I don't know! They had wyverns; I can't[NL]
imagine bandits using wyverns![A]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadJeanne]Wyverns?[....] This is not good[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter5Intro4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus][ToggleSmile]Uwee hee hee![....] We have them cornered,[NL]
like rats in a cage![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]But sir, there are other exits to[NL]
the village--[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] GAH![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]Silence! No insubordination allowed![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier]Uh, sir, that was our first lieutenant.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]It doesn't matter. The point is,[NL]
they aren't escaping us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Uh, affimative, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]NOW THEN![....] Dragon riders! We fly![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Do you mean wyvern riders?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]What? No, dragons![....] You see this mount of[NL]
mine? This is a dragon![A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]That's a wyvern, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Do I hear insubordination?[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Uh, no sir. That's a dragon, of course![NL]
My mistake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Damn right it's a dragon! Now then,[NL]
as I said, we fly![A][X]

##Chapter5Intro5
[OpenMidRight][LoadJunpei]We have to protect the mayor's house[NL]
at all costs![A][X]

##HexReceruitNormal
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentPortrait]Hello?[....] Is there someone home?[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadHex]Yes, what seems to be the matter?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]There are soldiers coming to raid[NL]
the village. You need to leave![A]
[OpenMidRight]Leave? Never. I will join you in this fight.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Are you sure about this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Hex. Point me where the enemy[NL]
is and they will drown in darkness.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright then[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Just be careful.[A][X]

##HexRecruitOstrava
[OpenMidLeft][LoadOstrava]Is anyone still here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadHex]Hello, who's ther--[....] Osty, is that you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]How did you know my[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Wait, is that you,[NL]
Hex?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Osty! I'm so glad to see you again.[NL]
What's going on?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]The town is under attack![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Alright Osty, I'll lend you my magic in this[NL]
fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Thank you, Hex, but you don't--[A]
[OpenMidRight]Too late. I've made up my mind.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Alright[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Just don't do anything[NL]
that would endanger yourself.[A][X]

##Chapter5ReinforcementWarning
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]Bah![....] This is taking too long![NL]
Call for reinforcements![A][NL]
I want their heads at my foot![A][X]

##Chapter5Village1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidRight][LoadOldWoman]It's been quite some time since our[NL]
little village has seen a raid like this![A][NL]
Last I remember was a decade ago or[NL]
so, some bandits came and attacked.[A][NL]
And never something this organized![NL]
Too far from the border for that.[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]What's this world coming to[ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][X]

##Chapter5Village2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidRight][LoadOldMan]]A raid?![....] Oh Merroi almighty, thank you for[NL]
warning us! My sword arm isn't as good[A][NL]
as it used to be, so I wouldn't be able to[NL]
protect my family if anyone came looking[A][NL]
for trouble. Oh, I know![....] You can have this![NL]
It's my old sword. Used it back in the day[A][NL]
to kill dragons, or those dirty manaketes.[NL]
You could probably make better use[A][NL]
of it than I.[A][X]

##Chapter5Village3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidRight][LoadYoungWoman]By the gods, this it terrible! Trisdam[NL]
has no proper defense force![A][NL]
The only ones who know how to fight[NL]
are Junpei and that little boy of hers.[A][NL]
I can only pray that you are able to[NL]
ward these mercenaries off.[A][NL]
Here, this may help you. It was my[NL]
brother's lance, but he left it with[A][NL]
us after he left to join the army.[A][X]

##Chapter5Village4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrentPortrait][OpenMidRight][LoadRedHead]My mother always thought that it safe[NL]
here in Trisdam[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] It's why we[A][NL]
moved here from the mountains, away[NL]
from the border skirmishes. I suppose[A][NL]
she was wrong, though. Not even[NL]
towns all the way in the valley are[A][NL]
safe anymore. Gods protect us[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

##Chapter5VsPerkus
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]Ha![....][NL]
You're good, but I'm better![A][X]

##Chapter5OstravaAndHisShadow
[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]Who are you? What[NL]
are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]A little birdie told me[NL]
that a certain Princess of[A][NL]
Vernet was in this village,[NL]
and that birdie also[A][NL]
happens to have put quite[NL]
a bounty on her head.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]Well, I guess you're[NL]
going to be disappointing[A][NL]
that birdie of yours.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]What? Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava]I--[....] Cause I'm gonna kick[NL]
your ass![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]Don't make me laugh, boy![A][NL]
Try as you might, you'll never[NL]
beat me![A][X]

##Chapter5PerkusAndJeanne
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]Ah![....] What a lovely flower[NL]
you are! You must be Princess[....][NL]
Jeanne![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]You know who I am?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]I do indeed, girl.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadJeanne]Then you must have heard[NL]
of my skill with the lance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]It doesn't matter how much[NL]
skill you have! You'll never[A][NL]
defeat me![A][X]

##Chapter5JoestarTechnique
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus]Men![....] We must advance[NL]
backwards![A][X]

##Chapter5SoldiersRetreat
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRedSoldier][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]D-Dammit![....] We underestimated them.[NL]
Retreat![A][X]

##Chapter5Ending1
[OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenLeft][LoadBen][CloseEyes]Merroi almighty, I hope that's the last time[NL]
I'll have to raise my blade for one day.[A][OpenEyes][NL]
Even I have my limits.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]What's that?[....] Is the mighty Bringer of[NL]
Chaos tired?[A]
[OpenLeft]Funny, coming from the one complaining about[NL]
being exhausted not five minutes ago, Ms.[A][NL]
"Only reason why I let you finish is[NL]
because I'm really tired."[A]
[OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarRight]You tykes had a long battle. Guess[NL]
I can't blame ya too much.[....] Ha![A]
[OpenRight]Indeed. After such a long day, they would[NL]
be bound to get exhausted.[A][NL]
I am a bit tired myself.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][OpenEyes]Didn't you say you were hungry too?[NL]
You were in prison for a while.[A]
[OpenRight]Yes, it has been quite a while since[NL]
I ate a proper meal.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Ha! So much for the young and energetic.[NL]
I can make you all some grub,[A][NL]
and then it's time for bed.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]The mighty Ben Von Fatassaru has no need[NL]
for nutrients! My stomach has the ability[A][NL]
to hold onto a single meal for days at[NL]
a time, I gained this ability by training[A][NL]
for years in[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][HalfCloseEyes] in th[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] the[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] th--[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft]Zzzzzzz...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][CloseEyes]Bed.[....] Now.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenFarRight]Looks like the little guy collapsed.[NL]
I'll get him to bed.[A]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadOstrava]Yeah, sounds good. Is your house[NL]
still open to us?[A][X]

##Chapter5Ending2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPerkus][OpenMidLeft]Damned rats![....] How dare they make a[NL]
mockery of me![A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadRedSoldier]Uh, sir? We need to focus on retreating.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]I NEVER RETREAT![A][NL]
We are merely advancing back[NL]
to our patron![A]
[OpenMidRight]I believe that's called retreating, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did I give you permission to talk back?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then would you like punishment[NL]
for insubordination?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, sir.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Then shut your trap! Men, we're leaving![A][X]

##Chapter5Ending3
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenMidRight][LoadJunpei][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]Thank you again for letting us stay here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Don't you worry about it. After that,[NL]
y'all need some sleep.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Ma, we'll have to leave early in the morning,[NL]
if you don't mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Leavin' so soon? Ya just got back.[NL]
Where you goin' in such a big hurry?[A]
[OpenLeft]Well, we must rush back to the capital,[NL]
Reunere at once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Reunere[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] that's a long ways out.[A][NL]
What's a girl like you doing all the[NL]
way out here?[A]
[OpenLeft]Well, I had responsibilities to attend to close[NL]
to the border.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ya don't say? What kinda stuff you on?[A]
[OpenLeft]Reports of bandits and such were abound,[NL]
and I was sent to deal with them.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]That's how I ended up running into her,[NL]
actually. She got in a fix, I got her out,[A][NL]
and skadoosh, we're here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft]I owe quite a lot to your son,[NL]
including my life.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Then ya shouldn't be dragging him around[NL]
from now on.[A]
[OpenLeft]He is welcome to stay here if he desires.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]She's not dragging me around, Ma,[NL]
I'm just doing the right thing here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]No, boy. We get involved if the folk need[NL]
us. Not her ilk.[A]
[OpenLeft]My ilk?[....] What is it that you mean?[A]
[OpenMidRight][HalfCloseEyes]You ain't as subtle as you think, girly.[A][NL]
Shiny armor, luscious cape, and you're[NL]
wearing a damn tiara. I don't want my[A][NL]
boy involved in any of your political[NL]
mumbo jumbo.[A]
[OpenLeft]I have no ill intentions or ulterior motives. My[NL]
only goal is to return to the capital safely[A][NL]
and with everyone unharmed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]And what after, huh? Just gonna send[NL]
his happy ass back here with a pat[A][NL]
on the back? My boy deserves better![A]
[OpenFarLeft]Ma[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft]Do not even believe for a second I[NL]
would not reward him greatly for aiding me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]It's not about a reward, it's about--[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadZo][CloseEyes][OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][HalfCloseEyes]Am I interrupting anything[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]What do ya want, munchkin?[A]
[OpenFarRight]Ben's talking in his sleep[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]And?[A]
[OpenFarRight]It's keeping me up[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]Fine, fine, I'll go up there. I'll be back[NL]
for you in a minute.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadJeanne][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenRight]Your mother cares for you greatly.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] sorry about that. I see what she was[NL]
getting at, though.[A]
[OpenRight]Indeed. I only wish I was able to calm her[NL]
fears.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]We just don't have great experiences with[NL]
fancy folks.[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft] B-But you seem fine, ma'am,[A][NL]
honest.[A]
[OpenRight]Thank you, Ostrava. I strive to be a good[NL]
Princess for my people.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]You're welcome.[....] Try not to take what she says[NL]
to heart. She's just worried. Wouldn't you be[A][NL]
worried if your kid was running off with some[NL]
strange lady?[A][CloseEyes] Er,[....][OpenEyes] not that you're[NL]
strange! I just mean,[....] ya know.[A]
[OpenRight]I know what you are talking about. She does[NL]
not know me. She may have heard of me,[A][NL]
but she does not know me.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] We'll get you there, okay? I'm not sure[NL]
how long it'll take, but we'll get it done.[A]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Indeed, we shall.[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][LoadJunpei][ToggleSmile]...[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight]Oi,[....] eyes up, kiddos.[A]
[OpenRight][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadJeanne]What is it, Madame?[A]
[OpenFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]Do you know how far the capital is,[NL]
lass?[A]
[OpenLeft]It is about a week and a half journey by[NL]
foot. If we all rode horseback, it would[A][NL]
shorten a fair bit.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alright.[....][LoadOverworldFaces] Give me 'til the morning. I'm coming[NL]
with ya.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Really?[A]
[OpenLeft]Are you sure you want to join us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Someone has to make sure you take care[NL]
of my boy after all this. Who better than[A][NL]
me to do it?[A]
[OpenLeft]I understand. We will take your company[NL]
graciously.[A][X]

##Chapter5EndingHex
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarRight][LoadJunpei][OpenRight][LoadJeanne][OpenFarLeft]Oh, that's right. Ma, I'd like to[NL]
introduce you to an old friend.[A]
[OpenFarRight]An old friend, eh? Who is it? Do I know[NL]
'em[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I'm not really sure if you've met her,[NL]
to be honest.[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadHex]You expected someone buff, but it[NL]
was me![....][OpenLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft][ToggleSmile] HEX![A]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, Hex. I think I've seen you 'round[NL]
once er twice.[A]
[OpenRight]Hex, you said? It is a pleasure to meet you.[A]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]It's a pleasure to meet you, too.[A][X]

##Chapter5Ending4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadJunpei]Hey kids! Rise and shine![NL]
We're heading out soon![A]
[OpenRight][LoadZo][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]Mm...[....][ToggleMouthMove][HalfCloseEyes][NL]
Wha? You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] You're coming too?[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadBen][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]Mmmmm...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Who[ToggleMouthMove]...?[....][ToggleMouthMove] Who has[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] s-summoned me,[NL]
Ben[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Von Fatassaru[ToggleMouthMove]...?[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Yeah, yeah. Get up and get dressed.[A]
[OpenRight]But we didn't change[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]Eh?[....] Good. We can get going faster.[NL]
C'mon, we're gonna hit the road.[A]
[OpenRight]But I'm hungry[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarRight][OpenEyes]If it's quite alright, I would like some[NL]
feul as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Y'all can eat later. We gotta get goin'.[A]
[OpenRight]But we didn't eat last night.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Ya can eat on the road. We gotta get out[NL]
before the sun gets too high.[A]
[OpenFarRight]With all due respect, Madame, how can[NL]
you expect us to perform our best on an[A][NL]
empty stomach? To be a great hero, one[NL]
must have a full belly![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Hunger builds character. Now c'mon,[NL]
get goin'.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]*sigh*[....] Yes, Mom[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]
