[OpenMidLeft][LoadZorua][OpenFarLeft][LoadOstrava][OpenFarFarRight][LoadGlazette][OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Do I smell fire? Did someone burn[NL]
something?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]There.[....] You're free to go.[A][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, thank you. Are any of you wounded?[A][NL]
I can't do much besides heal, but[NL]
I would quite like to thank you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]No, we're all unwounded.[NL]
Can you stand?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Yes, I can stand.[....] Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm Ostrava, and these are my[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] friends?[NL]
And you are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]My name is Glazette; I am a cleric from the[NL]
Church of Merroi. I was on a mission trip,[A][NL]
when I was captured by these wayward[NL]
souls about a week ago.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Lucky break, then. Think you can[NL]
get out yourself?[A]
[OpenMidRight]No[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] no, I cannot. My sight is gone, you see.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] guys?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Well?[....] Help her out. I don't think all four of[NL]
us are needed to escort one person out of a[....][NL]
jail cell.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Actually,[....] I would like to help you. I may not[NL]
have my vision, but I can still heal you.[A]
And we are sure to find more of these[NL]
brigands as we try and escape.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You have a good point[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Well, fine,[NL]
you can come along with us until[A][NL]
we finish here. How does that[NL]
sound?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I can accept those terms.[NL]
Under my staff, you wiil not die.[A][X]
