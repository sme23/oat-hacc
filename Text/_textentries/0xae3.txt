[OpenMidRight]Huh?[....] Who's cutting who up now?[A][NL]
Are you an elite member of[NL]
this band of thieves?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Elite? I guess you could say I am.[A][NL]
Though it's not like I give a shit about these[NL]
extras anyway. They're a means to an end.[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's awful! Even if they only exist to[NL]
serve a purpose, they're still your comrades![A][NL]
And if not, then you maybe need better[NL]
hobbies than killing.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Killing is all I know.[....] It serves my[NL]
purpose, and that purpose is revenge.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Juliana. What's it to you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am Elizabeth, and I wish to join you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Fine.[....] Maybe this way you can put[NL]
your skills to use and find something to do[A][NL]
other than make due on your vendetta.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Maybe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
