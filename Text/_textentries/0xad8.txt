[OpenMidRight][LoadOstrava][OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][OpenMidLeft]Ugh[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What a miserable situation this is.[A][NL]
How would my many many many many[NL]
many many many admirers at home feel[A][NL]
if they found out their favorite Hero of[NL]
Justice was captured by some no-name[....][NL]
bandits?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I know whatcha mean.[....] If my teacher[NL]
saw me right now, she'd chew my ear off.[A][NL]
But hey,[....] at least we're not dead or[NL]
anything.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Did you say[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] she? So[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] is she[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
How should I word this[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Comforting on the eyes?[A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]Dear gods[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]What? This is a very seroius concern![A][NL]
How can you focus on anything when you're[NL]
enarmored with a fair maiden's beauty?[A]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]We're stuck in a jail cell,[NL]
unarmed, and lost![A][NL]
It doesn't matter if she's pretty, what[NL]
matters is how we can get out of here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh,[....] you're no fun.[NL]
But you're right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Look, you seem like a bright guy,[NL]
and Zo seems pretty crafty herself.[A][NL]
I'm sure we can figure something out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]Hmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[OpenEyes]You seem crafty with your fingers.[NL]
We will wait for a guard to pass by.[A][NL]
Most brigands have something sharp on[NL]
them. I will get the attention of said guard,[A][NL]
and you'll see if you can pull something[NL]
out without being noticed.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Ooooor[....] we could wait it out.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Oooooooooooor.[....] We could wait for[NL]
a guard to come-- and follow me on this.[A][NL]
You tell the guard you found something[NL]
seriously shiny in the cell.[A][NL]
They're probably dumb enough to believe[NL]
that much.[A][NL]
I always keep a vulnerary[NL]
hidden in case of emergency.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft][HalfCloseEyes]Please don't ask where.[NL]
[OpenEyes]And thank the gods they didn't find it.[A][NL]
I'll break a shard off the bottle[NL]
so we have our item in question.[A][NL]
When he comes in, I'll break the bottle[NL]
over his head, and we'll make our escape.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Simple enough,[....] right?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]I don't even want to start[NL]
with how bad of a plan this is.[A][NL]
But fine, we'll do it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]Great![....] Glad to have your support![A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes](I'm going to die in here[ToggleMouthMove]...)[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
